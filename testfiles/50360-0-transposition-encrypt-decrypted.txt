MARY S. ROBINSON._CHAPTER IX._THE TATAR INVASIONS—1224-1264.The Russian principalities, weakened by civil wars, had no time forfederation or concentration against the race that, moving with theswiftness of wild horses, darkened the horizon of the realm withtheir coming in 1224. Their aspect was rude, gross, and frightful:collectively, they were like an army of goblins. An English writer, whohad perhaps witnessed one of their attacks, describes them: “They havebroad and flat visages of a tanned color, yellow and black; thin hayreupon the upper lip, and a pit upon the chin. Their speeche is suddenand loud, speaking as if out of a deep hollow throat. When they sing,you would think a cow lowed, or a great Ban dog howled. They suffernot their children to eat till they have shot near the Marke, withina certain scantling.” The bellowing of their cattle, the neighing oftheir wild horses, the grinding of the wooden wheels of their wagons,heightened the din and terror of their approach. In appearance and inwarfare they were, in effect, half a million maniacs, mounted on horsesas frenzied as themselves. Such conception of government as they had,took form in companies or hordes, who lived together in consentingcommunities, guarded by hosts of mounted archers. The poet, MatthewArnold, in “Sohrab and Rustum,” gives a vivid enumeration of a Tatarhost, as it mustered “by the broad-flowing Oxus,” many centuries priorto the period whereof we write:    “Kalmucks and Kuzzaks, tribes who stray     Nearest the pole; and wandering Kirghizes,     Who come on shaggy ponies from Pamere:[B]           *       *       *       *       *     The Tatars of the Oxus, the king’s guard,     First, with black sheepskin caps, and with long spears;     Large men, large steeds, who from Bokhara come,     And Khiva, and ferment the milk of mares.     Next, the more temperate Toorkums of the south,     The Tukas, and the lances of Salore,     And those from Attruck, and the Caspian sands—     Light men, and on light steeds, who only drink     The acrid milk of camels, and their wells.     And then a swarm of wandering horse, who come     From far, and a more doubtful service owned—     The Tatars of Ferghana, from the banks     Of the Jaxartes—men with scanty beards,     And close-set skull-caps; and those wilder hordes     Who roam o’er Kipschak and the northern waste.”The lieutenants of Genghis, Tchep and Subudaï-bagadur, leaders of theinvasion, fell upon the princes successively, cut down their smallarmies, struck terror into the remoter regions of the realm by therenown of the Asiatic conquests, and by the well-nigh incredibledevastations made on Russian soil. The report was bruited that theTatars had closed with the Polovtsui in southeastern Russia. Thesesent messengers imploring help from the descendants of Vladimir,saying: “The Tatars have taken our country; to-morrow they will takeyours.” Scarcely had Mstislaf the Bold, in Galitsch, son of Mstislafthe Brave,[C] summoned Daniel of Volhynia, Mstislaf Romanovitch ofKief, and the other leading princes of the south to arm for the commoncause, when the Tatar scouts had wet their horses’ hoofs in the LowerDnieper. By the Kalka, a small stream coursing to the Sea of Azof, thebrave, incautious Russian chivalry came within view of the innumerablemounted barbarians, moving with the speed and the obedience of one man.Mstislaf the Bold, Daniel of Volhynia, and Oleg of Kursk, precipitouslyurged by their angry contempt of the wild pagans, and by theireagerness to seize the honors of victory, closed with the dark swarms.In the height of battle, the Polovtsui, seized with affright, fell backdisorderly upon the Russian ranks, causing disturbance and discomfiturethroughout the army. The strange, wild sounds of the foe, the dust andclouds of arrows, added to the confusion, and soon the rout becamegeneral. The soldiers fled in terror from horsemen, the like of whomthey had never seen, not even among the Petchenegs or the Drevliané;and for the princes nothing remained but instantaneous death, or flightto the Dnieper. Six of them already lay stiff and stark upon the field,amid seventy of their chief boyars, and nine-tenths of the fightingforce; for of the one hundred thousand Russians, barely ten thousandescaped alive from the banks of the Kalka. Mstislaf Romanovitch ofKief had not been apprised of the rash advance of the three Princes,and consequently had remained within his earth-works on the bank ofthe Kalka. Abandoned by the fleeing remnant of the Russian host, hemaintained a show of self-defense, until the Tatars made proposalspermitting him to retire without molestation, on condition that ransomwere paid for himself and his drujina; a condition violated as soon asit was accepted. The drujina were cut down by the sword; the princewith his two sons-in-law was stifled between planks. This day ofnational ruin closed with a festival held by the invaders over theirslain victims.The realm was silent with terror. Mourning for the fallen brave,burial of the dead, universal dismay followed this onslaught, that hadbeen so sudden, so overwhelming, as to overpower any resolution forfurther defense. All at once, without notification, the multitudesof the Tatars vanished as swiftly and as mysteriously as they hadappeared. One would have said their horses had invisible wings. Theyhad crossed the Ural River, and were reported as beyond the CaspianSea. They had returned to their late conquered lands of the East,where they remained during thirteen years, strengthening their hold,increasing in boldness, and ever and anon invading China with theircloud-like hordes. The Princes reverted to their usual discords,the Mongols gradually ceased to be talked of, save as a frightfulapparition that had disappeared as unaccountably as it had advanced.Yet the sagacious and the learned among the Russians were not withoutforebodings. A comet had traversed the heavens in 1224, prior to thedevouring invasion. Its re-appearance was regarded as a warning, an_avant-courier_ of the Tatars. The chroniclers record with alarm theseasons of scarcity and of pestilence, the conflagrations of towns, andespecially the earthquake and sun eclipse of 1230, as portentous omensfor the imperiled realm.In 1237 the nomads who traversed the lands long before occupied by theBulgarians of the Volga,[D] gave notice of a second irruption of theMongol hosts, in a line of approach toward Suzdalian Russia. Forthwithfollowed tidings of the destruction of the “Great City,” capital of thehalf-civilized Bulgarui, and the massacre of all, or nearly all, of thepeople of that region. The invaders, led by Batui, nephew of Genghis,plunged into the forests of the Volga, and sent forward to Riazan twoenvoys with a sorcerer or Shaman. “If you want peace give us a tributeof the tenth of your goods,” ran their message. The ancient Slavcourage and quickness that had spurred the Princes by the Kalka, wasstill regnant; and Riazan, with the neighboring States, represented inall by seven Princes, made answer: “When we are dead you may have thewhole, if you can get them.” But, as before, the rude, wild race laidlow the bravery of the nobler one. The Russian soldiers were cut down,till scarce any were left to tell the story of the day of ruin. Feodor,one of the fair youth of the Russian chivalry, as he lay bleeding onthe field, exclaimed: “I thank thee, Great God, that thou takest me nowto thyself. Mine eyes shall not behold Euphrasia the spoil of Batui.”Euphrasia, his beautiful wife, learning his fate, and forecasting herown, leaped from her castle window, her infant boy in her arms, crying:“Receive me, Christ and Feodor! Me, the hunted prey of the savage!”Oleg the Handsome, found bleeding from many wounds, among his deaddrujina, repelled the offers, the caresses of the Khan, and was hewninto fragments. The ancient capital, the whole principality of Riazanwas laid waste with sword and fire.The stronger powers of Tchernigof and Suzdal had stood aloof in thisunequal conflict, but were speedily punished for their supineness.Iuri (George) the Second, Grand Prince of Suzdal, and nephew of AndreiBogoliubski, was driven from the field of battle by his mounted foemen,who also burned the young growing city of Moscow, and laid siege to theancient capital, Vladimir-on-the-Kliasma, left to the guard of Iuri’ssons, while he went northward in search of help. The citizens preparedfor their fate. Their bishop, Metrophanes, invested the princes andthe boyars with the tonsure and the monastic garb: for the ancientcustom of Russian royalty and nobility is to go down to death thushabited, symbolizing a formal renunciation of and separation from theworld. When the Mongols, breaking in at all the gates simultaneously,swarmed into the revered capital, their first act was to burn thecathedral, whither had taken refuge the family of Iuri, with all thewealthy and powerful of the principality. Amid the crackling of theconflagration, the falling of timbers and roofs, the fierce war-criesof the barbarians, the souls in the sanctuary passed to their eternaldestiny. The cities of Suzdal, Rostof, Iaroslavl, fourteen other largetowns, and nearly all the villages of the principality were destroyedto the last house, and the last man, in this all-devouring campaign.The Mongols went in search of Iuri, who was in the realm of Novgorodraising recruits for his army. When he learned the fate of his capital,he cried: “Alas, that I have lived to see this day! Why am I left ofall my people?” His headless body received burial at the hands of theBishop of Rostof. Vasilko, Iuri’s son, was of comely mien and graciousmanners. The Tatars, notwithstanding their ferocity and brutishness,were susceptible to the charm of beauty, and certain among them spokegently to him: “Stay with us. You shall bear the banner of Batui. Heis worthy.” “Never will I put my hand to the banner of the foemen ofmy country, and of the Lord Christ,” replied Vasilko. “Great as is mywoe, ye shall never force me to lift my hand against a Christian. Thydestruction will also come, O heavy and cursed power! There _is_ aGod, and you are doomed to perdition. Thither will you be hurled, whenyour cup is full, ye human tigers!” At these bold words, wrung froman agonized, but noble Slavic heart, the barbarians “gnashed upon himwith their teeth,” thrust at him with their sabers, and flung his bodyinto the forest of Scherensk, whither it was rescued, in time, and laidbeside the remains of his father.On their return route, the Tatars razed “Tver, the ancient and therich,” and Torjok, where “the Russian heads fell beneath the Tatarswords as falls the grass before the scythe.” All traces of humanhabitation and human life disappeared in the track of their wanderings;for their cloud-like advances could not be called a march. The GreatRepublic began to tremble, for they had passed within her frontier. Butswollen rivers, and forests till then untrodden by human feet, delayedthe host, who sought, moreover, a softer clime and booty more easilyobtained. It surged up to the Cross of Ignatius, within fifty milesof Novgorod Veliki, and there turned to the southeast. The village ofKozelsk (in the modern government of Kalouga), resisted to the death,and caused severe loss to the attacking squadrons. They named it theWicked Town, and left not one of its people alive. Its young prince,Vasili, was drowned in a pool of blood.Pereiaslaf and Tchernigof, though defended with similar desperation,suffered the same destruction (1238). All Russia, save the principalityof Kief, was red with the blood of her children, or marred by theconflagrations kindled by the Asiatics. Mangu, grandson of Genghis,coveted the city whose praises had been uttered ofttimes by travelersand merchants in the Orient. From the left bank of the Dnieper he gazedupon its walls of hewn stone, its springing towers, its many-domedchurches, roofed with silver and gold. Such a city in such a sunlight,not even a Tatar could despise. Could it but be preserved intact, atrophy of the conquest, it might well serve as a capital, a center forthe incoming conquering race. Messengers were sent across the river,offering what the chief considered doubtless as fair conditions ofsurrender. But though Riazan, Vladimir, Tchernigof, Tver, venerablecapitals of powerful states, had been burned to ashes, the indomitableSlavic heart would[Illustration: [_Map showing the position of the tribes formerlyinhabiting Russia._]] not endure the thought of servitude. The Kievanstrampled the envoys under foot, and awaited their own fate. Mikhail thePrince, with Daniel of Galitsch, and the Prince of Volhynia took refugein Poland and Hungary. Dmitri, deputy of Daniel, led the citizens indefending the Polish Gate, the attacking point of the enemy. Batuibrought up its main body with an uproar that seemed to cause the earthto quake; the grinding of the wooden chariots, the cries of the camels,the neighing of wild horses, the war shrieks of the Tatars, the plyingof their rude rams, united in such a confused turmoil as drownedthe voices of those within the walls. Scarcely could the commandsof Dmitri be understood. He with his Kievans, however, stood in thebreach till sundown. The next day they retreated to the enclosurepalisaded around the Church of the Tithe, defending their shrine as mendefend their altars when their last hour has come. The greater part ofthem perished, write the chroniclers, around the tomb of their greatIaroslaf; the khan, however, commanded that Dmitri’s life should bespared; he would not see so noble a foeman ignominiously cut down. Thecity was then given over to the fury of the Asiatics. The venerableChurch of the Tithe was so far destroyed that nothing remains of it, atpresent, save a few fragments of mosaic, preserved in the museum of themodern town. The Monastery of the Catacombs, founded by Saint Antonyfrom Mt. Athos, where the saints lived and died in tombs of their ownconstruction, was violated; no spot more redolent of sanctity, morerevered than this, exists in the vast Russian Empire.[E] The splendorof the ancient Slav capital, fatally obscured by this second and mostruinous violation, has never been recovered. Kief has never thoroughlyshaken from her garments the ashes of the Tatar brands.The great states of Volhynia and Gallicia, abandoned by their princes,were in no condition for a resolute resistance, after the ruin of therest of the realm. They bent themselves to the Mongol yoke, which hadnow been imposed upon all Russia outside the Great Republic. Those ofthe people who had escaped the Tatar arrows, were made slaves. Thewives of boyars who had been surrounded with luxury, clothed in costlystuffs from the Orient, adorned with jewels and with golden collars,became the menials of the rude and filthy Tatars, were forced to cooktheir mutton and grain, and to grind their mills.When the Princes of Galitsch, Volhynia, and Kief reached WesternEurope, the nations were greatly moved. Louis IX. prepared for acrusade. Friedrich Second, Emperor of Germany, wrote to the othersovereigns: “This is a moment to open the eyes of all men, now thatthe gallant princes on whom we counted are enslaved or slaughtered.”Meanwhile the Mongols, ever wandering, impelled by the assertion of thegreat Genghis, that all the earth should become subject to one emperor,passed westward to the hills of Hungary, and were met by a Polish hostat Liegnitz in Silesia. Their advance was strongly contested at Olmütz,in Moravia, where the Tchek voïvode, Iaroslaf, conducted a stubborndefense; nor did they pass eastward of this strongly fortified place:for learning there from the west that the King of Bohemia, allied withthe Dukes of Austria and Karinthia, was coming with a mighty host toconfront them: learning too, from the east, of the death of Oktai,successor of Genghis, Batui turned his horses’ heads, and made his wayback to the Caspian, his force greatly diminished by the dense andhostile population of the hill region of Silesia, and by the continualmolestation of a well-trained Polish cavalry, alert and well-prepared.It was the Slavic peoples,—the Russians, Poles, Silesians, andMoravians,—who bore the shock, and suffered the terrors of this last ofthe great Asiatic incursions. A few heroic Europeans on the outskirtsof European civilization, sent backward the last tidal wave of barbaricinvasion.Upon the European steppes, apparently extensions of the Asiatic plains,beside a branch of the Lower Volga, Batui paused to build a “castle,”or city, Saraï, that became in time the capital of the Russian Tatarempire, the Golden Horde—so called from its sending a tent made ofcloth of gold to the Grand Khan in Asia, as a part of its annualtribute; or perhaps from the chief tent of Batui, which was made ofthis precious stuff. This empire, called also Kipschak, extended fromthe Ural River and the Caspian Sea, westward to the mouth of theDanube, seventeen hundred miles; and from north to south, above athousand miles, covering an area of one million seven hundred thousandsquare miles, or about half the area of our republic. Here gatheredthe Tatar Mongols, or modern Nogais, the remnants of the Petchenegsand the Polovtsui (Kumans), the Bashkirs, and later the Kalmucks, withvarious Turkish nomad tribes, such as the Tatars of Astrakan, and theaboriginal Finnish populations,—all save the last named invaders of theRussian realm from the ninth to the eighteenth centuries. The GoldenHorde remained tributary to the first three successors of Genghis,but revolted from the fourth, Khubulaï, conqueror of the Chinese, andannounced itself an independent empire in 1260. United and strongunder the firm reign of Batui, it fell into dismemberment under hissuccessors, till Khan Uzbek, in the fourteenth century, restored itsunity and its primal prosperity. Gradually the nomads who settled uponits vast plains accepted the faith of Islam, and enrolled themselvesamong its fiercest propagandists. Gradually, too, they adoptedpartially the civilization of the people they had enslaved. The modernRussian Tatar is mild, peaceable, industrious, has a keen eye to trade,and unless in military ranks, cares nothing for warfare. But the adventof his race ushered a night of gloom over the young empire. All itsarts and industries were annihilated for a century or more; its peoplewere massacred or enslaved, its governments shattered, its nationalgrowth hopelessly obstructed. Its original Orientalism was intensifiedand used as the groundwork for the uprearing of an Oriental barbarism.The fine sensibilities, the poetry and grace, the generous spirit andgentle, hospitable manners of the Slav, were inoculated and depraved bythe cruelty, the contempt of life, the falsehood, treachery, perfidy,and filthiness of the Mongol barbarians. One of the laws of Genghiswas that clothes must never be washed, but worn without washing tillthey decayed. A like prohibition extended to the cooking utensils. Thevirtues and vices of his race have been enumerated as those of theanimals of their zodiac:    Thievish as mice,    Strong as oxen,    Ferocious as panthers,    Cautious as hares,    Subtle as serpents,    Horrible as dragons,    Mettlesome as horses,    Obedient (to their rulers) as sheep,    Child-loving (of their offspring) as apes,    Faithful (to their over-lord) as dogs,    Unclean as swine.Their ferocity led to the report in Greece and Western Europe thatthey had dog’s heads, and lived on human flesh. The degeneracy ofthe ancient Slav began with the entrance of the horsemen of Tchepand Subudaï-bagadur into the Russian realm. In the modern Russian,compounded of Finn, Turk, Tatar, and German, scarcely a trace of thenobler Slav lineaments is evident; and from the fourteenth century thecurrent maxim gains continually in veracity: “Scratch a Russian and youfind a Tatar.”    [To be continued.]A GLANCE AT THE HISTORY AND LITERATURE OF SCANDINAVIA.VI.—THE ROMANCE OF AXEL:[Concluded.]Translated by L.

Oh! it were blessed, far from strife     In some sweet vale where peace has made     Her home beneath the mountain’s shade,     To live with thee in blended life.     Alas! my oath, my oath prevents.     With hateful look, as here we stand,     It speechless thrusts its icy hand     Between our hearts, and bids me hence.     But fear not; I shall be released     With honor from my stringent oath,     And when next May shall bid us both     To her luxuriant, floral feast,     Then shall I surely come again,     And claim thee as my bride, my wife.     Farewell, thou jewel of my life,     Farewell, a long farewell till then!”       And with the word he turned away.     He took his sword, and king’s commands,     And through Czar Peter’s hundred lands     Resumed his swift and dangerous way,     Oft hid in woods the whole day through,     And guided in his paths by night     From heaven’s peerless signal light,—     The star of Northland, steadfast, true,     Or by those stars in heaven’s crown,     Which know no hour of going down,     The Wain of Charles, with argent beam,     And wheel-spikes forged of brightest gold.     And thus he rode through risks extreme,     And hordes of foemen manifold,     To Mälars palace, where amid     The council’s wonderment he told     How had escaped their sovereign bold,     And gave the letter as he bid.       But meanwhile in her vacant halls     Maria murmured Axel’s name,     In woods her sighs repeat the same,     And vales and hills send back her calls.    “What oath, pray, was it so austere?     Some maid in that bleak land so dear,     An older flame? or is there more     Than one? My heart spurns three or four!     Thou Northern maid in snow attire,     One of us twain must to the grave!     Thou knowest naught of Southern fire.     Beyond thy farthest frozen wave,     Beyond thy snow-peaks burdened high,     I’ll search thee out, for thou must die!     Yet—went not Axel when a boy     From home? Nor has he since that day     Returned, and far from all annoy     Of camps and strife love flees away.     Yes, only truth and honor dwell     On such a brow, and arched so well.     His steadfast gaze have I looked through,     Down to the bottom of his heart,     As deep the searching sunbeams dart     Through spring-depths, clear and silver-blue.     Why fleest thou then? What craved the test     Of oaths? Was it to crush this breast?     What—but in space my protest dies,—     A widow faint with bitter sighs,     A dove which roams with weary cry     Through earth and heaven without reply.     Yes, forests sigh and torrents fall     Between us, he hears not my call.     What! if I followed him?—But no!     It were not meet for woman so.     A _woman_,—who will know? If I     But wear a sword, the man is made.     With danger I have often played,     And staked life when I threw the die.     From horseback I was never thrown,     Nor ever carbine failed me aught.     Yes, God inspired in me the thought.     Now Axel thou art all my own!     I seek thee in thy land of birth,     I search for thee throughout the earth,     From dale to dale, from strand to strand,     And all oaths from thy lips I wring.     Now take me, War, upon thy wing,     And set me down in Axel’s land!”       So said so done. Resolve and deed     Are one with woman, and with speed     She is disguised. A casque compressed     And hid her dark abundant hair,     A doublet stayed her swelling breast,     Her powder-sack she filled with care,     And from her fair white shoulder slung     Death’s telescope, her carabine.     Down from a belt of Greek design     A crooked sabre gleaming hung,     And either lip and cheek she smeared     With black,—the hint of future beard.           *       *       *       *       *     She seemed, thus girt with belt and sword     Like Love in hero’s garb concealed,     Or Klinias’ son’s fair form restored,     Once painted on the gleaming shield.       “Farewell, my father’s home, farewell!     I shall return with love and dwell     Again within thy walls some day.     I can not wait, I must away.     Hide me beneath thy veil, O Night,     And give my Axel to my sight.”     Already lay upon the strands     Of slumbering Sweden’s vanquished lands     Czar Peter’s city, which has since     Held crowns in pledge from many a prince.     Then was it paltry. On its bay     It like a new-born dragon lay.     Yet nature is betrayed in young     That coils itself on heated sands,     Already venom in its glands,     And hisses on its cloven tongue.     A fleet to ravage Svea’s[F] shores     Was lading there with murderous stores,     And thitherward Maria pressed,     And where the ships received their hoard     Traced out her way, and made request     That she might have a place on board.     An officer who walked the quay,     And saw, surprised, addressed her then:     “You seem more dangerous, Sir youth,     To Northern maids than Northern men.     However it shall go with thee,     They can not tweak thy beard, forsooth!     Yet thou canst learn of them the whole     Of war: it is for death or life;     But either issue of the strife     God and Saint Nicholas control.”       The sails are set, the keel cuts through     The foam, and hastens toward the west,     And Svea’s cliffs soon rise to view     In sunset flames: they stand at rest     Amid the swirl of tide and wave,     The giant landmarks nature gave     Of old to warn of dangerous strands.     They landed on the famous sands     Which skirt the base of Sota’s reef,     Where parted Hjalmar[G] from the side     Of Ingeborg,[G] his faithful bride,     Where afterward she died of grief,     When Odin called the youth above     To Valhall’s courts, to do his will;     And there her ghost sits lingering still     Upon the cliff and mourns her love.           *       *       *       *       *       But towns are blazing one by one,     And children shriek and women fly;     Too well they know the war begun,     And bells are ringing far and nigh     Both night and day the call to arms.     Alas! the dead hear no alarms.     Woe! wretched land! what arm can save?     Thy valiant men are in their grave.     But still the peril of the land     Joins boys and old men in a band     With swords which smote on German mail,     And saw Gustavus’s hosts prevail,     And halberds wielded with despatch     In Denmark, worn with victory,     And curious shapes of musketry     With rusted locks, and kindled match.     Such was the kingdom’s sole defence,     A paltry troop, and weaponed ill;     Without surprise or doubt it still     Went forth to drive the foemen thence.     These did not battle hand to hand,     But spread their cloud across the land,     And lightened from the mountain’s crown     Where boldest hearts could not aspire,     And unrevenged death thundered down     On scanty ranks with ceaseless fire.       But then, as cometh angry Thor     With hammer, girt with manhood’s belt,     So Axel came and joined the war,     Where flight prevailed and horror dwelt,—     An angel sent in time of need.     His arm is death, his glance a frown;     He posts his men, spurs up and down     The lines upon his foam-white steed.    “Stand, Swedes, close up the ranks again!     I have been sent by Carl to bring     His greeting home to all his men.     Our watchword, God, and Carl our king!”     God and King Charles sound through the field.     They follow where he leads the way,     And heights from which the death-shots play     Are stormed, and in a moment yield.     And so was stopped the throat of hell,     And fields were sown with weapons well,     And blindly raged the sword throughout     The terrible and bloody rout,     Till awe-struck swept the robber-band,     With quick-snatched cables from the strand.       Now like a sated beast of prey     Lay Slaughter sleeping on the field.     From heaven’s tent the moon revealed     The awful scene with pitying ray.     Along the shore, with sighs, alone,     Went Axel where the dead were strewn.     They lay by twos, men face to face:     How fierce the grasp of their embrace!     A faithful clasp wouldst thou behold?     Think not of lovers who enfold     Each other, smiling tenderly;     Go to the battlefield and see     How hate, inflamed by death’s fierce smart,     Can press its foeman to its heart!     Ah! charms of love and happiness     Are fleeting as the zephyr’s breath,     But hate, and sorrow, and distress     Are faithful even unto death.     Thus musing, in the darkness nigh     He heard the words of weak complaint:    “O Axel, water! I am faint,—     A last farewell before I die!”     He started at the well known sounds,     And looking on the rocks espied     A youth unknown who leaned beside     The sharp cliff, pale and weak with wounds.     The moon broke through the cloud and shone     Upon the face, and with a groan     Of trembling horror bitterly     He shrieked, “O Jesus, it is she!”       Yes, it _was_ she. Despite constraint     Of pain she spoke in accents faint:    “Adieu, O Axel; we must part,     For death stands knocking at my heart.     Ask not why we meet here to-day.     Naught but my love brings me away.     Oh! when the endless shadows close     And man stands by death’s open door,     How changed from what it was before     Seems life with all its paltry woes;     And nothing but a love like ours     Shall rise with him to heaven’s powers.     I craved to know thy oath austere,     And that it was which brought me here.     Now I shall search it out on high     Among the stars of purest ray     Where it is writ, and shall espy     Thine innocence as bright as they.     I know I acted foolishly,     I know thou sorely mournest me.     Forgive me, for my love and trust,     Each tear let fall upon my dust!     I had not brother, sire or mother;     _Thou_ wast my mother, father, brother,—     Thou wast my all! O Axel, swear     In death that I am dear to thee!     Thou sayst it,—thou contentest me.     The sweetest of its sagas rare     Hath life told me. Shall we not part,     Thy maiden folded to thy heart?     And shall not here her dust be blended     With this dear soil thou hast defended?     See, Axel, yonder cloud shut in     The moon. When it shines out again,     I shall be dead. My spirit then     Shall on far-distant shores begin     To pray all good, and with all eyes     Of heaven, watch thee from the skies.     Set on my grave a Southern rose,     And when in snows its bloom shall fade,     Child of the sun, think of thy maid     Who slumbers under Northern snows.     Her morning years were quickly passed,—     See, Axel, now the cloud moves fast—     Farewell,—farewell!”—She sank, and sighed     And pressed her lover’s hand, and died.       Then forth from realms of nether air     Not death, but death’s young brother rose,—     Pale, fierce insanity, which goes     With poppy wreaths in streaming hair,     And glares up sometimes at the sky,     And sometimes downward at the earth,     Distorts its ashen lips in mirth,     And weeps from its low-burning eye.     It comes and touches Axel’s brain,     And ever afterwards his feet     Pace round the grave with restless beat,     As once in saga-days the slain     Were wont to flit, and linger nigh     Where some deep-buried treasure lay,     And all the shore heard night and day     His pitiful, dejected cry:—    “Be still, ye billows, cease your roar;     Ye must not smite so on the shore.     What do ye but disturb my dreams?     I can not love your foamy streams     That dance blood-mixed along the sands,     For ye bring death to these my strands.     Here lately lay a youth and bled,     And roses on his grave I spread,     For he was like—I know well whom;—     I bear _her_ home in spring’s first bloom.     They tell me that earth lulls my love     To slumber, that grass grows above     Her faithful breast: they are deceived—     She sat upon the rock and grieved,     Pale was she as one painteth death,—     But that came of the moon’s faint light;     And cold her lips and cheek that night—     That came but of the north wind’s breath.     I bade my own beloved stay,     Her fingers stroked my locks away:     My brain was dark and heavy then,     But soon methought it light again.     Far off in yonder east there shine     The vanished days, alas! how few,     Those days as fair as heaven’s blue     When Axel lived the life divine.     A castle stood in groves of green,     And in that castle dwelt a queen.     I lay in forests murdered there;     She brought my life back in a kiss,     And from her heart she gave me bliss,—     Her heart of love, so warm and rare.     Now lies it frozen in her breast,     Her withering breast, and all is past!—     Ye stars of yonder spaces vast,     Take off from me your burning eyes!     A morning star as bright as ye,     I saw sink in a bloody sea.     It smells of blood yet by the strand     And blood there is upon my hand.”       Such was his plaint on Sota’s shore,     Where yet he stands at break of day,     At night-fall will not go away,     But lingers weeping as before.     One morning saw him lifeless there,     His hands clasped upward as in prayer,     While on his cheeks the last tears lie,     Half stiffened in the morning’s chill;     But on the grave is fastened still     The viewless luster of his eye.           *       *       *       *       *       Such was the saga that I heard;     How deep my tender heart was stirred.     Full thirty years have passed away,     Yet lives it in my soul to-day.     For with lines definite and sharp     Stand childhood’s fancies graven well     In hearts of skalds, where small they dwell,     As Aslög[H] in King Heimer’s harp,     Till summoned they come forth as she,     Betraying god-like pedigree     In dazzling raiment, gestures high,     And golden hair, and kingly eye.     Ah! full with golden lyres is hung     The heaven of our childhood’s hours,     And all that skalds may since have sung,     As great as heroes, small as flowers,     Already in a fairer guise     Has passed before our youthful eyes.     Yet when melodiously ring     The far-piped notes of quails in spring,     When leaves the moon its eastern wave,     A ghost uprising from the grave,     And paints so mournfully and still     The hue of death on dale and hill,     Then sounds of sighs invade mine ear,     Then seems as if I still could hear     The ancient tale, and told so wide,     Of Axel and his Russian bride.    [To be continued.]PICTURES FROM ENGLISH HISTORY.By C. E. BISHOP.VII.—THE JOHN BROWN OF THE ENGLISH SLAVES.Macaulay has remarked as singular the fact that two great relics ofbarbarism in England were never abolished by law: disappeared, meltedaway before the advance of civilization. These were feudalism and humanslavery.It is also a remarkable fact that there never was in England aninsurrection of the laboring classes, save one, that in the reign ofRichard II., of sad fortune. The same can not be said of any othernation. This favorable contrast for England is due to several causeswhich we need not recount. But England’s one servile rising came verynear putting an abrupt end to serfdom by violence; emancipation wassanctioned and pardoned by royal writs, and would have been confirmedby act of Parliament had that body contained fewer slaveholders at thetime; _i. e._, had it been more truly a representative body of theEnglish people.Wat Tyler was the John Brown of that movement, and Richard of Bordeauxcame near being its Abraham Lincoln. Death in the guise of the BlackPlague had struck a fierce blow at English slavery about the middleof the fourteenth century. [See last CHAUTAUQUAN.] It made labor soscarce that the old laws binding the laborer to the soil and compellinghim to work without hire, proved abortive; insomuch that we findParliament soon at work passing the new “Statute of Laborers.” Itwas made to reach as well freedmen as serfs, for it said any man whowas out of work “must serve the first employer who shall require himto do so,” and must not accept higher wages than obtained before theplague; and it forbade him going beyond his parish to hire out, underpain of arrest as a vagabond, branding on the forehead with a hot ironbeing one of the penalties. But this statute did not work, either; forsucceeding Parliaments adopted it over and over again. That was theway they made laws more binding. King Edward I. reaffirmed to respectthe Great Charter some thirty times. And yet, farmers and lords whoselands were lying waste, or whose herds were running wild for want ofhelp, would offer large pay to get it and men were reckless enough tohire out to those who would pay the most, the much-enacted Statute ofLaborers to the contrary, notwithstanding.Then a crazy step was taken. An effort was made to supply landlordswith unrequited help by remanding freed serfs to slavery on frivolouspretexts and legal technicalities, the ex-master usually controllingthe decision of the manorial court before which these questions weretried. Of course the accused freedman had there little chance forright. The consequence was that the woods and wastes Boon becamefilled with bands of men who had been slaves, had tasted the sweets offreedom, and had turned outlaws and chronic vagabonds sooner than comewithin the reach of such “justice.”While this was going on, during twenty years, other things helped tocreate the spirit of insubordination. John Wickliffe had begun tothunder against the tyranny of Rome and the corruptions of the clergy,and to preach individual liberty of conscience. The sect of Lollards,of which he was the head, had offshoots of ruder tenets and practices.A preacher named John Ball had for many years itinerated, with allEngland for his circuit and the fields, market-places and church-yardsfor his chapels. He “preached politics” with an unction and genuineeloquence, as this condensed report of one of his sermons will show:    “Good people, things will never go well in England so    long as there be villeins and gentlemen. By what right    are they whom we call lords greater than we? Why do    they hold us in serfage? If we all came of the same    father and mother, of Adam and Eve, [see the danger of    putting the Bible into common people’s hands!] how can    they say or prove that they are better than we, if it    be not that they make us gain for them by our toil what    they spend in their pride? They are clothed in velvet    and warm in their furs and their ermine, while we are    covered with rags. They have wine and spices and fair    bread, we oat-cake and straw and water to drink. They    have leisure and fine houses; we have pain and labor,    the rain and wind in the fields. And yet it is of us    and of our toil that these men hold their state.”And John Ball, like all men who move the masses, boiled his wholepolitical and religious platform down into a motto with a rhyme to it,so that the most stolid ignorance could learn and remember it—for,mark you, poetry is the aspiration of the ignorant as well as theinspiration of the gifted:    When Adam delved and Eve span,    Who was then the gentleman?Immortal old epigrammatist and poet of democracy! His lines are heardto-day wherever manhood rebels against the pride and tyranny ofproperty. It was in every poor man’s mouth in England for a quarter ofa century, and it did a wonderful work, that little couplet. Such isthe power of a thought!There were other street orators and other poets. An Oxford studentwrote “The Plaints of Piers, the Ploughman,” the saddest, fiercestprotest against caste that England ever heard.While all this work was going on in the huts and fields of England, herproud nobles were squabbling over the dotage and around the dying bedof Edward III., and for the control of his grandson, Richard II.; andwhile they were thus dissipating government, her enemies were assailingher on all sides. Armies and fleets were raised, and campaigns andexpeditions fooled away, while the treasure was squandered in bothmilitary failures and court prodigality and corruption. Taxes werelaid, on the heels of defeats which made the old archers of Cressy,Nevill’s Cross, and Poictiers mad with shame and rage.The crowning act of folly and injustice came when Parliament laid apoll-tax on every person in the kingdom over fifteen years of age. Thismade the poor man pay as much as the rich; and more, if the poorer theman the larger his family, which was probably the case then as now.There were no census statistics, and the tax-gatherers had to make adomiciliary visit in every case, an inquisition Englishmen especiallyresent; for the feeling that every man’s house is his castle datesback to the life of family segregation for which they were remarked inold Roman times. The tax, payable in money, came hard on poor people,who generally worked for their food and clothing, paid in kind. Withan exaggerated idea of the population of England, Parliament had notlevied a large enough unit per head. The rich, instead of helpingthe poor heads of families to pay the tax, as directed in the writs,shirked their own share. Thus the returns were insufficient to meetgovernment needs, and the tax-gatherers were sent out again, withsheriffs’ posses, to glean more thoroughly.With all these exactions when the times were ripe for an outbreak, youmay be sure England was soon in a fever of excitement. Collectors’processes began to be resisted, and they and their posses driven awayby force. One day a rough collector went into the house of a man inDartford, Kent, named Walter, a tyler by trade. Demanding his tax thecollector insisted, in spite of the mother’s denial, that the eldestdaughter was over fifteen years of age, and at last, to settle thedispute, he made an insulting proposition and laid hands on the girl.The screams of the mother and children brought the father running fromhis shop, hammer in hand, and seeing his daughter struggling in thearms of the man, he smashed his brains out with the hammer, regardlessof the royal coat-of-arms. Walter himself had worn that uniform, forhe had been a brave campaigner in France. The deed was done, and hislife was forfeit. Instead of shrinking from the consequences, he placedhimself at the head of his neighbors, who now gathered around him. Hishammer had struck the percussion cap to the mine long prepared.In another part of Kent there was another outbreak. A noble claimeda runaway bondsman and shut him up in Rochester Castle. The peoplestormed the castle and delivered the prisoner-slave to a doublefreedom. Couriers now went through all England bearing calls to rise,couched in rude rhymes which tell at once of the lowly state of themasses and of the art of those who called to arms. One ran thus:    “John Ball greeteth you all,     And doth for to understand he hath rung your bell,     Now, right and might, will and skill,     God speede every dele.”There were several other leaders, and some of the proclamations wereissued anonymously. They ran thus:    “Help truth and truth shall help you. Now reigneth    pride in place and covetise [covetousness] is counted    wise, and lechery withouten shame, and gluttony    withouten blame. Envy reigneth with treason, and sloth    is taken in great season. God do bote! for now is time.”    “Jack Carter prays you all that ye may make a good end    of that ye have begun, and do well and aye better and    better. For at the even men heareth the day.”    “Truth hath been set under a lock, and falseness and    guile reigneth in every stock. True love is away that    was so good and clerks [priests] for wealth work us    woe. God do bote for now is tyme.                               [signed] “JACK TREWMAN.”These unmistakable references to preparations already made, help usto understand how it was that almost in a day Wat Tyler found himselfat the head of a hundred thousand men marching on London. One forceunder a leader named Jack Straw, came by Canterbury, which threw openits gates, as “the whole town was of their sort,” and they guttedthe palace of the archbishop, who had ground the face of the poor byassuming a monopoly of all the grinding of grain in his district, onwhich he had placed excessive toll.There is something very pathetic in this movement on London. Theywould appeal to the young king himself, and not to the selfish dukes,his uncles, who guarded him and misgoverned the realm. The son of theBlack Prince, the defender of England, and, so long as he lived, theprotector of the people against the cruelty of the nobles, shouldhear their appeal and do them right. It was said the boy king was nobetter than a prisoner in his uncles’ hands; peradventure they mightdeliver him and themselves by the same blow. All the way to Londonthey made everybody they took swear allegiance to Richard. But all thelawyers they captured they hung, as the instruments of oppression, thecontrivers of technicalities by which freedmen had been re-enslaved.And thus they settled down on Blackheath, before London, June 12,1381. Panic had gone before them. John, the Duke of Lancaster, fledto Scotland, deserting the young king he had overruled with no gentlehand. All the knights and nobles about the king threw themselves intothe tower. The king’s mother, the widow of the Black Prince, hearingof the disturbance in her country home, made brave by a mother’s fear,hastened to London, passing through the camp of the insurgents unhurtand with honor; she kissed Walter Tyler and Jack Straw and took theirdevotion to her son.In the general panic Richard was the only man in England equal to theemergency. Man! He was only sixteen, but at about that age his fatherhad won his spurs at Cressy. He took boat on the Thames and roweddown to the insurgents’ camp. The Archbishop of Canterbury and someministers were with him, and when Tyler asked the king to land and talkwith them, promising respect and loyalty, this prelate prevented him,thus confirming the stories of the king’s duress. The rescue of theirsovereign became their first object. They marched on the city, and thesympathizing citizens threw open the gates.Lancaster’s stately Savoy Palace was soon in flames; also theMarshalsea and the King’s Bench Temple, the dwellings and offices ofthe hated lawyers. But one of their number who undertook to carry offa silver tankard from the destruction was immediately drowned in theThames. “We are no thieves and robbers; we are not nobles and bishops;we are honest workingmen, come to deliver the king and ourselves,”said Tyler. The next day they captured the tower, took the archbishop,the royal treasurer, and the commissioner of the poll-tax, and cut offtheir heads as traitors on Tower Hill.The king, now delivered from his court, sent word to Tyler thathe would meet them at Mile-End, just out of London, to hear theirgrievances. The knights of the Tower and the guards wanted to gathera force and attack the mob, but the king rode out unarmed, with a fewcompanions, to this historic appointment.It was a memorable scene, and a poetic coincidence. The day was theanniversary of that other demand for rights from King John. Just onehundred and sixty-six years before Magna Charta has been wrung froma king at Runnymede. Now the boy king and the peasant leader meet totreat on equal terms. Justice levels all distinctions. The graceful,delicate and beautiful descendant of the Plantagenets and the rough,unkempt, Celto-Saxon artisan—the personification of the two armies atHastings—the types of the extremes of English civilization; extremesdestined to draw nearer together through centuries of civil war, ofmartyrdoms for free thought and speech, of sufferings and defeats, everbravely and persistently renewed by generation after generation oflaborers on the one side: through discrownings, beheadings and gradualcurtailment of royal power on the other. Two chief agencies were todraw these extremes together—gunpowder and printer’s ink. The one toblow feudalism off the earth and put an end to baronial domination—theother to unlock the storehouses of thought and introduce the ruleof mind, to the permanent limitation of those other two classes oftyrants: priests and kings. The despised class, represented by theruder of these two “high contracting parties,” is to rise by slow andstormful evolution: the slave to become freeman—the freeman, yeoman—theyeoman, citizen—the citizen, an elector of rulers; out of all to beevolved that splendid, conservative, expansive power of England, theMiddle Class. Happy England! that the two extremes stood that day andthereafter not as antagonists but as treaty-makers.Richard found the Toussaint l’Overteur of that day prepared withvery distinct and well-grounded grievances, though not numerous orunreasonable. He asked—First—The abolition of slavery.Second—Limitation of rent of land to fourpence an acre.Third—Liberty to buy and sell in all markets and fairs, withoutfavoritism or toll.Fourth—Pardon for what they had done in order to obtain this interview.The young king, more just than well-informed, more generous thanpolitic, promised it all, and said he would immediately causefranchises and letters of pardon and emancipation to be drawn up underthe royal seal. Great shouts of joy went up—premature shouts indeed!During all that day and succeeding night thirty clerks were busydrawing up the charter of freedom and amnesty for every parish andtownship; and the next day the great body of the insurgents marchedhome, the king’s proclamation in their hands, the king’s banners overtheir heads, and in their hearts such joy as the children of Israelfelt when Miriam’s timbrel rang out its triumph over the Red Sea.Well if this had been the end of it; but there was to be a dark andbloody finale for Richard and Walter. Walter Tyler and many of theKentish men remained behind, dissatisfied with the terms of the writs.We do not know the causes of Tyler’s refusal to accept the charters.Perhaps he foresaw what must and did come: that as soon as thispressure was removed from the young king, and his evil counselorsagain got control, all that had been given to the people would bewithdrawn, and he wanted guaranties of fulfillment, just as the baronshad done with John. However it was, we only know that the King and hisattendants riding through Smith Fields the next day, chanced upon Tylerand his followers. Tyler rode out alone to speak with the king, and themayor of London reproached him for approaching the king uninvited. Hotwords followed, and the mayor stabbed Tyler dead, in sight of all hismen.Instantly thousands of arrows were drawn to let fly on the king andhis party. Well for him had they sped and ended his unhappy careerthere, with the crown of emancipator upon it, instead of the failure,disgrace, and violent death that were to terminate it. Putting spurs tohis horse he rode directly into the midst of the angry mob. “I will beyour captain! Follow me!” he cried. This seemed to their simple-mindedloyalty the obtaining of the end for which they had come out, and theyfollowed the boy with docility to the fields at Islington, where aconsiderable force of royal troops was met. The king restrained thecourage which now returned redundantly to the nobles and forbade theslaughter they were anxious to begin, dismissing the peasants to theirhomes.And now the nobility began their revenge everywhere, and the embers ofresistance were again blown into flames here and there. Green sketchesthe stamping-out of the fire:    “The revolt, indeed, was far from being at an end. A    strong body of peasants occupied St. Albans. In the    eastern counties 50,000 men forced the gates of St.    Edmondsbury and wrested from the trembling monks a    charter of enfranchisement for the town. Sittester, a    dyer of Norwich, headed a strong mass of the peasants,    under the title of the ‘King of the Commons,’ and    compelled the nobles he had captured to act as his    meat-tasters, and to serve him during his repast. But    the warlike Bishop of Norwich fell lance in hand on    the rebel camp and scattered them at the first shock.    The villagers of Billericay demanded from the king the    same liberties as their lords, and on his refusal threw    themselves into the woods and fought two hard fights    before they were reduced to submission.”For many years there were camps of refuge of these outlawed peasants inforests and upon lonely islands—Englishmen exiles in their own countryfor the cause of human rights.The prelates and lawyers gathered around Richard with their sophismsand technicalities, to show him he had done an unlawful thing withhis proclamations of emancipation and clemency; the barons backed theconstitutional arguments up with fierce threats about this “royalusurpation,” insomuch that Richard within two weeks recalled andcanceled all his charters, and let loose the unrestrained arrogance ofthe nobles on the people. So many and such unwarranted executions tookplace that Parliament subsequently granted an act of indemnity to thesavage perpetrators, who, it says, “made divers punishments upon thesaid villeins and other traitors without due process of law, but onlyto appease and cease the apparent mischief.” All manumissions weredeclared void. But Richard submitted to the Parliament the propositionto abolish slavery if Parliament would lend its sanction. The lordsand gentlemen replied, “The serfs are our chattels, and the king cannot take our property from us without our consent. And this consent wehave never given, and never will give were we all to die in one day.”Had Richard insisted on keeping faith with the lower classes of hissubjects, had he placed his crown and life in the scale against humanslavery, he would have gone into history as the Great Emancipatorof Englishmen, or as Freedom’s Greatest Martyr. Either destiny waspreferable to the ignominious end he did meet. He was a man for anemergency, but not a statesman for one of the world’s great crises. Butin a boy of sixteen were not his conduct and his attempt at a greatdeed wonderful?It is a curious thing to reflect on that Abraham Lincoln, in agovernment of constitutional law and in a position of very limitedpowers, could with a stroke of the pen decree emancipation, whileRichard, a ruler of almost absolute powers in an age of ill-definedauthority and much lawless administration, could not take the chainsoff one of his subjects.At this distance it is difficult to determine just how much influencethe only servile uprising of England had upon the emancipation of herserfs. It at least stamped a wholesome dread of the laboring classesinto the selfish souls of the nobles, a dread that had much influenceon the contentions of succeeding reigns, and raised the common peoplein importance. Slavery did not disappear for over two centuries; “GoodQueen Bess” got her much gain by selling her subjects for slaves inthe West Indies. But if “they never die who perish in a good cause,”the blood of Walter the Tyler aided the cause of human liberty, and heought to be canonized as one of her martyrs, instead of being treatedas the violent and bloody rioter that most historians make him.    [To be continued.]ANECDOTES IN SERMONS.—The fashion which once prevailed of introducinghistorical anecdotes into addresses from the pulpit, is illustratedby the following extract from a sermon by the martyr Bishop Ridley:“Cambyses was a great emperor, such another as our master is; he hadmany lord-deputies, lord-presidents, and lieutenants under him. It isa great while ago since I read the history. It chanced he had underhim, in one of his dominions, a briber, a gift-taker, a gratifier ofrich men; he followed gifts as fast as he that followed the pudding;a hand-maker in his office, to make his son a great man; as the oldsaying is, ‘Happy is the child whose father goeth to the devil.’ Thecry of the poor widow came to the emperor’s ear, and caused him to flaythe judge quick, and laid his skin in his chair of judgment, that alljudges that should give judgment afterward should sit in the same skin.Surely it was a goodly sign, a goodly monument, the sign of the judge’sskin. I pray God we may once see the sign of the skin in England.”PHYSIOLOGY.Physiology is a science, because it embodies a collection of generalprinciples and ascertained truths relating to a particular subject,and is called a natural science because these truths are founded onobservation. The word “physiology” is derived from two Greek wordsmeaning a discourse about nature; but it is used in a restrictedsense, and is the science of the functions of the different parts ofany living body. Thus we have animal and vegetable physiology, whilethe former is divided into human and comparative. The first of thesedivisions relates only to man, while the other reviews the entireanimal kingdom.Our object is to teach some of the simple truths of human physiology;such as may be intelligible without any extended knowledge of othersciences. It must be remembered, however, that a more thoroughand complete study of physiology can not be undertaken without aconsiderable acquaintance with such sciences as mechanics, hydraulics,optics, etc., without which the action of the muscles, the circulationof fluids, and vision can not be properly and fully comprehended.Whenever a piece of mechanism, designed for some particular use,is brought under our notice, and we wish to understand its mannerof working, we naturally inquire about its structure; for withoutsome knowledge of how its component parts are put together, and bywhat means it is put in motion, we can not hope to understand how itperforms the part which we see it do. Such is the case, for example,with a watch or steam engine; their parts must be carefully studied inorder that their workings may be fully understood.Hence, it will be observed from what has been said, that it isimpossible to study the uses of various parts of the body without someknowledge of anatomy, this being that branch of knowledge which treatsof structure.In order that anatomy may be studied the organs must be dissected.The words “anatomy” and “dissection” have the same literal meaning, theformer being derived from the Greek language, and the latter from theLatin, meaning to cut apart or separate. But anatomy is employed tosignify the science of structure in living bodies, and dissection isused to denote the unravelling or laying bare the parts of the body, bymeans of which anatomy is studied.The words “organ,” “organization,” and “organize,” are so convenientand necessary that we must know what they mean. The word “organ”signifies some part or parts of the body that have a particular use orfunction: thus, muscles are organs of motion, and nerves of sensation;the eye is the organ of sight, and the heart and blood vessels are theorgans for circulating the blood. Now, any structure is said to beorganized, or to have organization, that possesses the properties whichdistinguish a living body from one that never had life. Therefore wespeak of the organic world as distinguished from the inorganic; theformer includes plants and animals, the latter minerals, etc.The nature of that mysterious principle which we call life is unknownto scientists. Yet we may know and understand many of those thingswhich are believed by physiologists concerning life. Certain of thembelieve that life is a phenomenon that follows organization; or, inother words, that organization is the cause, life the result; whileothers contend that organization is the result of life. In the formerlife is produced by changes that take place in matter, under theinfluence of those forces of nature called heat, light, electricity,and chemism; by the latter theory all these forces are present andact under the influence of a potent force called life. This will beour belief: Life is a distinct endowment, capable of propagation, andsuperior to all other forces by which it is attended. Let us see bywhat means living bodies are distinguished from unorganized. Livingbodies increase in size; so do minerals; the former by the additionof material throughout the tissue, the latter by outside additions.Organized bodies have a limited existence. All are subject to constantchange, and to final dissolution. They all spring from a parent, andonly originate in this method. The opposite characteristics belong tounorganized matter.It has been the business of chemistry to determine the ingredientsof the earth and atmosphere, by resolving them into what are calledelements. By the word element we mean that which can not be resolvedinto any simpler form. For example, take a piece of chalk; by chemicalaction it can be divided into a gas called carbonic acid, and a solidcalled lime; therefore, it is known that chalk is a compound body. Ifwe take a piece of iron or gold there is no process known by which wecan resolve it into simpler form, and these are therefore elements.There are over sixty elements and many of them are found in the humanbody. All these elements are derived from unorganized matter, and thespecial conditions under which they are formed in organisms is due tothe principle of life. The predominant elements that make up the humanbody are carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen, while iron, potassium,sodium, phosphorous, calcium, exist in smaller quantity. Thesedifferent elements are variously combined to form compounds, of whichwater is the most abundant, for it forms more than two-thirds of theentire weight of the body: water is a compound of hydrogen and oxygen.The principal organic compounds are albuminous, of which the white ofthe egg is a typical example; the gelatinous, or jelly-like compounds,including cartilage, oleaginous, or fatty compounds, and saccharine,or sugary compounds, such as starch. The first two contain nitrogen,hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon, while fat and starch are rich in carbon,but lack nitrogen. In tracing back the development of living matter toits simplest form, it is found to exist as specks without any definiteshape or structure, or as granules of extreme minuteness, perhaps theten thousandth part of an inch in diameter.This elemental living matter is called protoplasm. Its simplest form istermed a cell, and the word is applied to little bodies varying much inform. Thus some cells are really little bags filled with fluid. Suchare those in which the fat is deposited; others are disk like, otherslengthened, while some so-called cells are simply masses of jelly.Out of these organic compounds all the softer tissue of the body isformed, such as fibrous, muscular, cellular, and adipose tissue._Fibrous tissue_ consists of fine threads, arranged in various ways, toadapt it to some special use; some of these threads are elastic, othersare wholly inelastic. These tissues of mixed character form what iscalled connective tissue, which is found throughout the body.Fat is deposited in little cells situated in the connective tissue._Muscular tissue_, which forms the great bulk of the body, is easilyrecognized by its ruddy color, and it constitutes what is known as“flesh.” It is fibrous, and if these fibers be examined under themicroscope there will appear, in those under the influence of the will,transverse markings, while the muscles not under the will-power lackthese markings._Nervous tissue_ is that which superintends all the actions of theliving body. It is accumulated in nerve centers of which the principalis the brain. It consists of minute cells in these nerve centers, andof delicate tubes filled with nervous matter throughout the organs ofthe body. Such tubes are called nerves._The skeleton_ is the frame-work of the body, and serves to support allthe softer organs as well as to protect them. It is composed of boneswhich serve as attachments for the muscles._Bone_ is the firm tissue of the body, and to a certain degree is hardand brittle. If bone be burned its brittleness is very much increased,but if it be placed in acid it loses its brittle properties. Thus wesee that bone is made of two entirely different materials. The onecalled “animal matter” is easily burned out, while the other called“mineral matter” resists the action of heat, but is quickly dissolvedby acid. The mineral matter is a compound of lime. This it will be seengives to the bones their rigidity. Bones are of various shapes andsizes, adapted to the work which they have to perform.The most remarkable part of the skeleton is the spinal column, commonlycalled the back-bone. It is made up of twenty-six bones, or spines,which are united together in a marvelous manner, combining strength andfreedom of motion. Each spine has a central aperture which communicateswith that of the adjoining spines, thus forming a long canal in whichthe spinal cord lies. This cord connects the brain with the variousparts of the body. There is a soft cushion of cartilage between eachspine, which adds much to the elasticity of the back-bone, protectingthe brain from shocks. This protection is further accomplished bythe curvature of the spine. These bones are not placed directly overeach other, but are so arranged as to give three curves to the spinalcolumn. Along the column there are openings, at each joint, throughwhich the nerves come to supply fibers to the different organs of thebody._The spine rests on the pelvis_, which is a large double bone,basin-shaped, that sustains the abdominal organs. The pelvis, in turn,rests on the thigh bones._The thigh_ bone, “femur,” is the largest single bone in the body; itis joined to the pelvis by a ball and socket joint, an arrangementwhich permits its motion in any direction. The femur is supported bythe bones of the leg. These are two in number in each leg, the tibiaand fibula. The former is much the larger, and the latter is oftencalled the “splint bone.”The bones of the arm corresponding to those of the leg are the humerus,the radius, and the ulna. The humerus is the bone of the upper arm,and is large and strong; it articulates with the body in so perfect amanner that the great variety of motions required to be performed iseasily and gracefully accomplished. This bone is fastened by a balland socket joint, but is not, like the thigh bone, firmly fixed to animmovable bone. It is attached to a broad bone called the scapula, orblade bone; this is fastened to the body by muscles which give it greatfreedom of motion. The bones of the fore arm are the radius and ulna:these are nearly of the same size; in this they differ from the legbones._The wrist_, composed of eight bones, forms the support for thetendons, blood vessels, and nerves which pass to the hand. To these areattached the metacarpal bones which support the phalanges, or bonesof the fingers. The arrangement of the bones of the foot is, in manyrespects, like that of the hand. However, the bones of the foot form anarch which acts like a spring when the weight of the body falls on it,thus helping to ward off shocks and jars._The skull_ is a large bony case in which the brain is lodged, and bywhich it is protected. It is composed of several pieces firmly unitedby a very irregular line of union. The attachments of the skull are thejaw bones, nasal bones, and the cheek bones._Joints_ have been provided wherever parts of the skeleton requiremotion; they are of several kinds, chief among which are the ball andsocket, hinge, and flat joints. The hip has been mentioned as a perfectexample of the ball and socket joint, while the knee presents anexample of the hinge._Muscles_ are necessary to all motion, and are found everywherethroughout the body. They are the active agents, which, under thecontrol of the nerve centers, do all the work necessary to carryingon the functions of the organs. They are endowed with a remarkableproperty called contraction. How this is accomplished is not fullyunderstood, but when stimulated by nerve force or electricity theyshorten and widen. This brings their ends nearer together; also theparts to which they are attached. They are always attached to movableparts; their attachment is a tendon at one end, and a fan-likedistribution of their fibers at the other. Tendons are inelasticfibrous tissue, very strong, and consequently much smaller than themuscle. They are to muscles what tugs are to horses. Muscles are eitherflexors or extensors; the former bend the joints, the latter straightenthem._The skin_ forms an exterior covering for the body, and is employed forother and very important functions. Its appendages are the hair andnails. Some of the uses of the skin are these: It is highly sensitiveand capable of distinguishing various sensations; it has the propertyof excreting, of secreting, and of absorbing. It is an organizedtexture containing blood vessels, glands and nerves. It is composed ofseveral layers; the outside, called the epidermis, is not supplied withblood vessels, and is produced by the under layers._The glands_ of the skin are first, those which secrete theperspiration. This is poured out to keep the temperature of the bodyeven, also to rid the circulation of many injurious substances. Thenthere are glands which secrete an oily matter which aids in preservingthe softness and pliability of the skin. These glands are calledsebaceous glands. Hair is said to be an appendage of the skin becauseits texture is essentially similar to that of the cuticle. Nails, also,are but modifications of the skin. The fact that the epidermis is beingconstantly cast off and renewed, and that matter is both secreted andexcreted continually, renders frequent washing of the skin necessary tohealth._Digestion_—In animals the arrangements which exist for convertingaliment into blood are more or less complicated according to therequirements of each class; and this conversion is called assimilation,a term which includes digestion and those changes which take place inthe blood and tissues, by which new material is added to them.The preparation of the food for assimilation by the tissues isaccomplished in a long tube called the alimentary canal. This canalis made up of various parts having different functions and differentconstruction. These parts we will briefly describe. They are the mouth,pharynx, æsophagus, stomach, small and large intestine.As solid food requires to be broken up or ground before it passesinto the stomach, the mouth is provided with teeth firmly implantedin the jaws, while the lower jaw is moved by strong muscles in twodirections, one vertical, the other lateral. Man is supplied with twosets of teeth; the first adapted to the jaws of childhood; the secondlarger, which replace the former, are designed to last through life.The rudiments of each set are found in the jaws before birth. Duringthe grinding or mastication of the food it is moistened and softened bya fluid called saliva. This also acts chemically upon it, changing thestarch into sugar. The food is carried from the mouth to the stomach ina long tube called the æsophagus, by means of the muscular contractionof this tube._The stomach_ is a flask-shaped organ consisting of a double wall oftissue, the outer one being muscular, the inner one vascular. Thislatter membrane has a large supply of blood vessels, which convey theblood out of which the gastric juice is manufactured and secreted bythe little glands of this membrane. The gastric juice is a fluid whichcontains an active ingredient called pepsin. This, aided by the acidwhich this fluid contains, effects a remarkable change on the albumenof the food, making it a liquid. From the stomach the food passes intothe small intestine, where it receives from a small tube the pancreaticjuice which changes the fat into an emulsion._The intestine_ is a tube, about twenty-five feet in length, which,like the stomach, has a double wall. Its inner coat contains multitudesof little projections called “villi.” These contain blood vessels whichabsorb and carry off the liquified food. It also secretes a fluidcalled intestinal juice, which acts upon the unchanged starch, makingit into sugar. Its muscular wall by a continuous contraction produces amotion known as the “peristaltic motion,” which carries the food onwardin its course. The intestine also receives the bile, a fluid producedby the liver._The liver_ is the largest gland in the body. It receives the portalvein which conveys the blood from the intestines. This vein, afterdividing and sub-dividing, thus bringing blood into communication withall parts of this organ, is again collected into a main trunk whichpasses on toward the heart. During its passage through the liver thebile is eliminated from the blood by the little cells of which thisgland is composed. From the liver the bile is carried toward theintestine, into which it is poured to assist in digesting the food, andto be itself changed.Besides the little blood vessels in the _villi_ of the intestines thereis another set of vessels called the lacteals, which aid in taking upthe digested food and pouring it into the circulation; also, throughoutthe body a set of similar vessels collect the waste material and pourit into the great veins, returning to the heart, in order that it maybe renovated or cast off; these are the lymphatics._The kidneys_ are great excretory organs, and are similar in shape tothose of a sheep, but are somewhat larger. They are glands, and excreteurea, as well as other salts and waste materials, all of which arehighly poisonous if not removed from the blood._Blood_ is the life-giving fluid of the body: it is the source fromwhich all tissues are built, and it is the workman that carries thewaste material away from the tissues. In order to accomplish its workit must circulate, and this requires a separate set of organs. First,the impure blood must be carried back from the different parts of thebody; then it must be distributed again. It must also be made to flowonward in a continuous current. Blood is a viscid fluid, of a redcolor, containing over seventy per cent. water, with solid matter. Itscolor differs on each side of the heart. When it returns from the bodyit is blue, but when it leaves it is red. Under the microscope it isseen to contain minute globules, or disk-like cells; to these the bloodowes its color. It possesses the remarkable property of spontaneouscoagulation when drawn from the veins. It is forced on by the heart._The heart_ is a muscle and consists of four cavities; two calledauricles having weak walls, and two ventricles with strong muscularwalls. The blood returning from the body is poured into the rightauricle, thence into the right ventricle; from this cavity it is forcedthrough the lungs and returns again to the heart, being poured into theleft auricle, which empties into the left ventricle. This ventricleforces the blood throughout the body. The blood received by the heartfrom the body is impure, and is sent to the lungs, where it gives uppart of its impurities and receives oxygen from the air._Arteries_ are those vessels that distribute the blood, while theveins collect it and return it to the heart, thus all streams of bloodleaving the heart are conveyed in arteries, and those pouring into itare carried in veins._The lungs_ are the organs that purify the blood, and in order thatthis be thoroughly done, the blood is distributed throughout theirsubstance in minute capillary vessels. The lungs themselves arevascular; being made up of a multitude of air cells, their surfaceis greatly increased; hence their power of absorption. The diaphragmis a muscular partition lying below the lungs. It is dome-shaped, andwhen its fibers are shortened it enlarges the cavity in which the lungsare situated. This creates a partial vacuum, causing the air to rushinto the lungs. The blood absorbs the oxygen from the air and gives upcarbonic acid gas. When the muscles of the diaphragm are relaxed theelastic force of the air cells in the lungs expels the remaining gasesfrom the lungs. The diaphragm is assisted by the action of musclessituated between the ribs; these lift the ribs and enlarge the cavityof the thorax. The lungs also act as a reservoir for the air used inthe production of vocal sounds. They communicate with the atmosphereby means of a tube called the trachea; this terminates in the pharynx,with which the nostrils also communicate, thus completing a passage tothe outside air._The voice_ is produced by the modifications which the teeth, tongue,lips and throat make upon the sound produced by the vocal cords. Thevocal cords are stretched across the upper end of the trachea, which iscalled the larynx. The air from the lungs is forced past them, settingthem in vibration, thus producing sound._The nervous system_ consists first of all of the brain. This iscomposed of nervous matter and constitutes the mass contained in theskull. It is divided into three parts: the cerebrum, the cerebellum,and the medulla oblongata. These three parts seem to preside overdifferent functions. Thus, the cerebrum is the seat of the faculties ofthe mind, while the cerebellum presides over the muscular actions. Thebrain is connected with distant parts of the body by means of fiberswhich are distributed to all parts. These fibers are of two kinds,one set carrying the impressions to the brain, the other carrying thestimulus from the brain to the organs. The former are called sensitive,the latter motor nerves. A deep fissure separates the brain into twolateral halves, and these parts are connected with opposite sides ofthe body. Besides these nerves, which originate in the brain and passthrough the spinal cord, there are twelve pairs that pass directlythrough the skull to the organs which they supply. These are calledcranial nerves, and are distributed to the eyes, the nose, the ears,the larynx, the lungs, the face, stomach, etc. Ten of these pairs ofnerves originate in the medulla oblongata. Of the functions presidedover by these nerves may be mentioned those performed by the tongue,(taste), eyes, ears, and nose.Many of these nerves are not sensitive, in the ordinary use of theword. Thus, the retina of the eye is the expansion of the optic nerve,and, while it is sensitive to light, it is not to ordinary impressions,such as material contact. Also, the nerve of the ear is only sensitiveto the vibrations of fluids. We see by light reflected from objects.This light passes through a set of lenses, and by means of these animage is formed on the retina, which impression is carried to thebrain. Just how all this is accomplished is not known. The nerve of theear floats in a fluid called lymph. This fluid receives the vibrationsof bodies through the air, through the membranes and chain of bones,and thus the nerves receive and transmit them to the brain, which actconstitutes hearing.Volumes could not tell all that one single fiber of muscle containsthat is instructive, much less the entire functions, constructions,and mysteries of a single organ of special sense. And to perform allthe allotted functions every part must be in the best repair. Thisconstitutes health. Health is maintained by cleanliness, by repose,by muscular activity, by moderate eating, by plenty of fresh air, bya contented disposition, and a clear and active mind. Watch over yourbody with a jealous care, for all your future depends upon its goodcondition.SUNDAY READINGS.SELECTED BY THE REV. J. H. VINCENT, D.D.[_April 1._]THE LAW OF THE HOUSEHOLD.By E. A. WASHBURN, D.D.    “Honor thy father and thy mother; that thy days may    be long in the land which the Lord thy God giveth    thee.”—Exod. xx: 12.We open this second division of the Law with the duties of man to man;and at its head stands the commandment of the household. I must repeathere the remark of eminent scholars, that each of the original tablesprobably contained five statutes; and thus the maxim we now considerwas directly joined with the four concerning the worship of God. Sucha view gives us indeed a new insight into the Hebrew religion, whichlinked the first of social truths with a divine faith; it is theanticipation of his Gospel, who has taught us that the love of parentand children is the type of our holier bond in the family of Christ.But there is a yet further thought in the words of this “commandmentwith promise.” That “thy days maybe long in the land.” Those earliercommandments tower above us like the lonely heights, where Mosescommuned with God; but as we read this sentence, we see rise on theeyes of the lawgiver the landscape of far Judea, with its laughingfields, the voice of children and the home of calm old age. Thesewords suggest the whole line of our reasoning on this subject. Filialreverence is the fountain of all affections, all duties; it flows likethe river of Eden, parted into its branching heads, through everychannel of human life.It is then the family, as the institution which God has implanted inour nature, and Christianity has hallowed, that we are to consider. Iknow indeed no richer study than thus to trace its growth. I have notheories to offer you. It is the simplest of facts. There has been nomore favorite field for our philosophers than that of the origin ofhuman government. Some have fancied that men met together in formalcompact; others have held the state of nature that of a pack of wolves,at last brought together by self-interest to choose some kingly wolf,who could keep the peace; and we have to-day our sages, so enamoredof their researches into comparative anatomy, that they can pass byall the nobler facts of social history, and find the primitive man insome anthropoid ape. Yet as the grandest laws of God are revealed inthe nearest example, we learn more than volumes of such theory in thelife of our own households. Government began with the family. It isno artificial thing. It was not imposed by force. There is no stateof nature that goes before it; but as all our discoveries in organiclife lead to the primary cell, so all social formations are only theenlargement of this little human embryo. We need no other truth thanthat he, who gave us this moral being, made us to dwell in mutualdependence; and thus the germ of all authority lies in the relationof parent and child, in the care it calls forth, in the weaknessof infancy, and the natural reverence that springs from the heart.Open the Book of the Genesis; you see the patriarch Abraham dwellingin the tent with his children; you see this household passing intotribes, linked in a bond of brotherhood, reverencing the father ofthem all, who is priest and head; and you trace further on a Mosaiccommonwealth. History repeats the same early chapter in the Arab ofthe desert to-day, or in the beginnings of ancient Rome. “Society inprimitive times,” it is said by one of the wisest of English jurists,in his work on Ancient Law, “was not a collection of individuals; itwas an aggregation of families.” Among all early peoples the law ofthe household is thus supreme; it embraces all duties, and reaches tothe nicest detail of courtesy. The oldest laws of China are as richin their family wisdom as any in the world. Filial reverence was thecorner-stone of the state. I well remember with what surprise I sawthe son of a venerable Parsee, himself a man of fifty, wait behindhis father’s chair during a long interview; it was a vestige of thestately manners of the East, strangely contrasting with our civilizedrudeness. But if we will find the finest examples in the past, we mustturn to those scenes in the Old Testament, where the aged patriarchlays his hands on his eldest born in token of his birth-right, or thetwelve gather reverently about the bed of the dying Jacob to receivehis blessing. In this household life, interwoven with all their socialhabits, the heart of the Hebrew was nursed; and in many a quiet home,like that of Nazareth, there grew the blossoming graces of childhood,that made this history so pure amidst all its decays.But we must pass from this earlier view to the new life ofChristianity, if we would know its nobler influence. Many pureaffections and virtues grew without doubt in a heathen civilization.But the family authority was almost a despotism; the father had powerof life and death over the child, and woman was little more than aslave. The one great feature of all social progress, we are told bythe jurist already cited, has been the recognition of the rights ofthe person, instead of absolute family dependence. Here it was thatthe religion of the Gospel had its living power, and I ask you tostudy this wonderful fact in its early history. As we look back on thestate of society at that time, we are struck everywhere with the decayof those fair examples of chastity, of maternal virtue, of householdstrength which bloomed in the old Roman commonwealth. Family life hadwithered, because it had not in its ancient pagan form those elementswhich could preserve its influence amidst the shameless sensualityof the world. The public talk of the forum, the theater, the games,the busy out-of-door existence, such as you see to-day in SouthernEurope, were everything; nor was there a purer tide flowing into thegreat city, as from the country homes of England and America, tocleanse and freshen it. Religion was a brilliant temple pageantry.Thus, as in all pagan lands, you have the same striking facts; thedegradation of woman and the degradation of man with it. This it wasthat the religion of Christ changed. It taught, as its first truth,that God was our Father, and all men one brotherhood in Christ. Whata revelation was this beyond all that the pagan mind had known! Thepaternal power was no longer a despotism to the believer; the fatherknew that he had a Father in heaven, and that his child was no serf,but the household tie was a type of the holier family of God. Read thatclear utterance of the household law in St. Paul: “Children, obey yourparents in the Lord; fathers, provoke not your children to wrath.” TheGospel cherished above all else the family authority; yet it hallowed,sweetened, enlarged it. It nursed the virtues of the household. Itmade woman the companion of the heart and home; it hallowed marriage;it taught the love of Christ and the brethren, contentment, industry,frugality, sacrifice, and charity to the poor. What picture so fair asin the letters of that time of its fresh, healthful life; that “churchin the house,” breathing the soul of the early religion? The kingdomcame without observation, without noise; and a new home-born, home-bredsociety grew in the midst of the dying civilization.[_April 8._]THE LAW OF THE HOUSEHOLD.In this light, then, we can understand, brethren, the place of theChristian family, as always the first of social institutions. Suchis the view I wish to urge, because I believe that, far more than wesuppose, this law of the family enters into the most real questions ofour time as to popular education or social reform. We live in a dayof theories; and in such a day we are most apt to forget the simpletruths, which, in Coleridge’s words, “are so true, that they liebed-ridden by the side of the most exploded errors.” I speak no meresentiment; I address myself to the plain sense and Christian experienceof all. It is the problem that presses on us to-day more than ever,when we look at the mingled good and evil of our modern world; whenwe enter one of our great cities, where wealth glitters as if therewere no suffering, yet a step apart there lurks a world of beggary andcrime, which our Christianity has hardly pierced, although it has senta Livingston into the heart of Africa;—what is the hope of Christianmore than pagan progress, of a Paris or New York more than a Rome?I give the answer, which I think all history as well as the Gospelgives. The purity of the household is the salt of our civilization. Iknow no other answer. Need I then, state the ground on which such atruth rests? The only lasting influence which can preserve or heal thesocial body is one that works from the root. We can not, with dreamerslike Rousseau, believe the savage better than the civilized state.Art and science bring manifold vices with the good, yet we can nevergrapple with the sins of our day by vague railing against luxury. Inthe decaying age of the Roman world a Jerome retired into his caveat Bethlehem; but his idle despair did not cure the evil. We oftenindulge the same false humor. We speak of a London or a New York as theswollen ulcer of society, but we forget that we may as well talk of abody without its brain; that it is in mutual circulation, the countryfeeding the city with fresh blood, the city pouring it back enriched inits double circuit, the life is maintained; and thus while we see thevices, we should see also the enlarged activities, the myriad callingsfor the poor, the treasures of art and culture for all, the uncountedcharities walking in every haunt of sorrow or sin. But this growth ofcivilization has in it no self-preserving might. A refined culture isno safeguard against our moral diseases. We repeat often that thisAmerican people is abler to keep its freedom and virtue, because of theeducation of all: yet it is one of those surface truths that may covera fallacy. I believe heartily in popular education. But there is a moreknowing vice as well as virtue. The mob of Paris is more intelligentthan the country boor; but it is a witty and polished animal. Suchtraining, without a deeper root, only quickens the weeds in the rankfield of our time, and chokes the public conscience.Whatever, then, the form of our civilization, it must depend on thetone of our household life for its healthy growth, because thisprecedes all else in its shaping power. All the germs of personalcharacter, truth, purity, honesty, reverence of law, must be implantedin this soil. The state rests on it. The church rests on it, and itsteaching is barren, unless it begin with home nurture. We may makewhat laws we will for the suppression of vice, what plans we will ofeducation, what better methods of industry; but what are they withoutthe education of the character? What is our most perfect theory ofgovernment, unless there be a self-governed people? What are commercialrules, if there be no conscience of integrity and honor? Study thistruth in its widest bearings. Our time is marked by its noble effortsfor reform. We hail each healthy improvement in the condition of thepoor, the opening of new channels of labor, the breaking down of falsemonopolies.It is thus, my friends, we are to learn the bearing of such a truthon our own land and time. We can not study the growth of society,especially in our great cities, without observing that there aremany influences, such as I have already described in the old Pagancivilization, which tend to impair the purity of home. The familyhabits decay in the larger world of sensual splendor. It is becominga hard thing for our young men of fashion to afford the luxury ofmarriage; and our young women learn that the aim of life is a richhusband, who can supply the gold for the wardrobe and the glitter ofan establishment. We have imported from abroad within these few yearsmany of the loose ideas of modern Epicurism. But there are, besides,influences peculiar to our American society, which are developing atype of precocious youth not pleasant to look upon. I know not whetherit be the abuse of our free institutions, that begets our style ofmanners: but we are too fast losing the habits of home authority andfilial reverence. It has been truly said of us, that we have as muchfamily government as ever, but the young govern the parents. We haveno children now-a-days. Our infants leap from the nursery into thedrawing-room; and while abroad a son or a daughter has hardly leftthe retreat of home, here they are already veterans in the ways offashion, and society is quite surrendered to them. Many of our foreignvisitors have repeated the remark of De Tocqueville, that an Americangirl has more of self-poised ease, but is wanting in the fresh charmseen so often in the young maidens of England or France. I doubt notthere is a better side to this. I would not keep them, as is too oftendone abroad, shut in nursery or convent without the education of thecharacter. I love the intelligence, the generous freedom of youth, butI wish we might not lose with these the modest heart, the simple tastesof past years. It maybe the passing excess of our national childhood,but it is not to be flattered as it is too often. I know that I am veryold-fashioned in my ideas, yet it may be well if we soberly reflect onthese things. We may grow in wealth and all the arts of social culture,but let these fast habits of the time, this whirl of our modern lifeeat into the heart of our home piety, and the whole body must die ofits own gangrenes.In that conviction I urge on you, my friends, your personal obligation.Who of us can enough appreciate its meaning? Who of us, if he couldkeep afresh the feeling of awe and tenderness with which he looked onthe face of his first-born infant, and felt what an undiscovered worldwas opened to him, who would ever need to learn his duty? What a workit is, how ceaseless, how growing at each step, how delicate in all itsadaptations, how asking all our love, our thoughtfulness, our patience!I offer you no system of education. I repeat only the principle, whichI thank God is the root of all wholesome teaching, that a Christiangodliness is the growth of the whole character; and therefore it beginswith the recognition of the child as a new-born member of the familyof Christ; and plants its simplest truths in the moral affections,and blends them with the real duties of life. This is sound sense andpiety. This, in Wordsworth’s happy line, is    Pure religion breathing household laws.Give your offspring this training of the character; teach them to befrank and open-hearted, to hate a lie or a mean action, to be kind tothe poor, to protect the weaker, to respect gray hairs, to reverenceyour authority from love not fear, to cherish the natural pleasuresand employments of home, a book or a ramble more than the finery ofmodish children young or old; above all to be always constant in theirChristian habits, with no affectations of a premature piety, with achild’s faults, but a child’s sweet faith; give them, I say, thistraining, if you will have them men and women indeed.[_April 15._]FINDING AND BRINGING.By the REV. WILLIAM M. TAYLOR, D.D.It is a great thing when a man “finds” Christ. Now, in working out thisthought, we must have a clear idea of what we mean by “finding” Christ.Andrew and John were in visible and bodily contact with Jesus, and itmight seem, therefore, that it was an easier thing to come to Christwhen he was on earth, than it is now, when he is enthroned in heaven.But that is a mistake. Many came to converse with him when he lived inthe world, who yet failed to find the Savior in him. Multitudes mightbe pushed into contact with him that day when the poor woman timidlysought a cure by touching his clothes; but it was to her alone thathe referred when he said, “Somebody hath touched me.” Therefore, thecontact in her case must have been something more than physical, andcould be nothing else than the application of her soul to him in simplefaith for healing.In like manner, the finding of the Messiah by Andrew and John musthave been something else than their coming into conversation with him,and could be nothing less than a description of the fact that theywere intellectually convinced that Jesus of Nazareth was the promisedMessiah, and were sincerely willing to accept him as their Savior andguide.But the presence of Jesus in actual humanity before us is not essentialto the exercise of such confidence as that; and so soon as a manbecomes convinced that Jesus Christ came into the world to savesinners, and is willing to accept salvation at his hands, he “finds”Christ just as truly as he was found by Andrew and John, as recorded inthis section of the sacred narrative. Now, when a man “finds” Christthus, it is for him the greatest event of his life, dominating anddirecting every after-circumstance in his career.How much the history of the world has been affected by the discoverieswhich men have made! Take a few. The discovery of America; theinvention of printing; the discovery of the power of steam, andthe manifold application of the steam-engine; the invention of thetelegraph: who shall say how much all these have done for the progressof civilization? But put them all together, they have not done sogreat things for the world at large as the discovery of Christ doesfor every soul that “finds” him. It opens up a whole new world forhis exploration; it enstamps a new name and nature upon his heart; itbrings him under the influence of a motive principle which “laughs atimpossibilities,” and removes mountains; and it gives him a means ofcommunication with the unseen as real, as mysterious, and as immediateas that hidden cable whereon the messages of two hemispheres vibratein response to each other. It relieves his conscience from the weightof guilt; it elevates his intellect; it purifies his affections; itforms his character; it gives a new aim to his life and new center tohis heart, and brings him so under the constraining influence of thelove of Christ, that, while retaining the great outstanding marks ofhis individuality, he may yet truly be said to be a new man. See howthis comes out in Paul. Converted or unconverted, the man of Tarsuswould still have been a leader of his fellows. But mark how, afterhe has found Christ, his whole being goes into a new direction, andbecomes transfigured and ennobled by the change. His energy becomessublimed, his ambition purified, his nature elevated. Behold, also,how it appears in Peter! What a contrast between the fisherman and theApostle! And how much this discovery of Christ made by him, throughAndrew’s guidance, did to give him character and influence among men!Had he never found the Messiah, who had ever heard his name. But fromthis hour he begins to be illustrious! Said I not truly, therefore,that it is a great thing when a man finds Christ? It is indeed the verygreatest thing for safety, for happiness, for usefulness, for honor,that can be said of any man, when it is affirmed of him that he hasfound Christ. My hearer, can it be truly said of you?Notice, thirdly, that when a man has found Christ, he ought to bringothers to Jesus. The first thing Andrew did was to tell to anotherthe good news which had already thrilled his own heart. So Philip,as recorded in this same chapter, found Nathanael, and repeated thissame news to him. Indeed, it is quite worthy of note how often this“finding” occurs in this delightful narrative. Andrew “findeth”Messiah; then he “findeth” his brother. Jesus “findeth” Philip; andPhilip “findeth” Nathanael. So that, as Trench has beautifully said,in allusion to the well-known exclamation of Archimedes in connectionwith one of his discoveries, this “is the chapter of the Eurekas.”[I]“I have found him! I have found him!” Indeed, the promptings of one’sown nature here are in perfect accordance with the commands of theLord; for we can not but tell to others the tidings which have madeus glad; and in proportion to the happiness which they have producedin us, will be our eagerness to make others sharers with us in ourdelight. As Matthew Henry says here, “True grace hates all monopolies,and loves not to eat its morsels alone.” The woman of Samaria ran totell her townspeople of the great Messiah, and the disciples who werescattered abroad by the first persecution “went everywhere preachingthe Word.” The command is, “Let him that heareth say, Come!” and everyChristian should become thus a missionary of the Cross. Indeed, we havenot rightly heard, if there is not within us an impulse to say “Come.”If there be no enthusiasm within us for the diffusion of the Gospel, orthe conversion of sinners, we make it only too apparent that we havenot the spirit of Christ; but if our souls are stirred at the sight ofour perishing fellow-men, and our hearts prompt us to make efforts fortheir salvation, we prove that we are in sympathy with those celestialbeings among whom there is “joy over one sinner that repenteth,” andthat the same mind is in us which was in him who died that men might beredeemed.“As ye go, preach.” “Go into all the world, and preach the Gospelto every creature.” These are what the Great Duke once styled the“marching orders” of believers; and it is at our peril, if we refuseto carry them out. But when the word “preach” is used, let us bewareof supposing that we need all the outward accessories of a crowdedcongregation and a modern church, in order to obey this command.The meaning simply is, that we should tell the good news as we haveopportunity. We may “preach” by conversing with our friend as wewalk down with him to business in the morning, or by an incidentalremark introduced, not obtrusively and impertinently, but naturallyand lovingly, as we talk with our fellow-traveler in the steamboat orin the railway car; or by the giving of an interesting volume thatcontains the truth to some ingenuous youth upon his birthday; or byrepeating at the couch of some sick one the leading portions of asermon which we have just heard in the sanctuary; or by teaching aclass in the Sabbath-school; or by bringing a friend with us to churchwhere we know that the faithful preacher will be sure to have some wordthat will point out the way to the Cross; or even, without a word atall, we may preach the most eloquent and powerful of all sermons, bysimply living for Jesus where we are. There is a sphere for every one;and none can claim exemption from this great Gospel law, “As ye go,preach.”But who would desire exemption when there is so great need for theexertions of all? See how earnest the apostles of evil are to alluremen to destruction, through one or other of the several avenues thatlead to death; and shall we be less eager to labor for their salvation?Behold how indefatigable are the endeavors of those who live to spreadabroad the news of every day! What telegraphic agencies they use tobring to this one center the record of important occurrences the worldover! What magnificent machinery they employ to multiply the number ofimpressions of their journals! And how eager they are to send forththeir messengers in the gray morning twilight, to leave at everydoor their daily photographs of God’s providence as it reveals itselfto their eyes—alas! not always clear enough to read it right. Shallthey be so enthusiastic about the news of earth, and we be inactivewith the better news of the Gospel? It is told of the commentatorThomas Scott that, as he went to preach in a church in Lothbury at sixo’clock in the morning, he used to observe that, if at any time inhis early walk he was tempted to complain, the sight of the newsmen,equally alert, and for a very different object, changed his repininginto thanksgiving. So, every time we take up a newspaper let us feelreproved for our remissness in telling the good news of God’s salvationto our fellow-men; let us be stirred up to self-sacrifice and devotionin this glorious cause, and let us resolve to do our utmost in bringingothers to the Savior whom we have found for ourselves.Notice, in the fourth place, that, in seeking to bring others toJesus, we should begin with those most intimately connected with us.Andrew first went to find Simon, his “own brother.” In like manner,Philip sought his friend Nathanael. And the Lord Jesus himself laiddown the same general law when he commissioned his disciples to preachrepentance and the remission of sins “among all nations, beginning atJerusalem.” Now, this is a point of pre-eminent importance; for amongthose who really desire to be useful in the world the idea is toocommon, that they must go somewhere else than where they are in orderto find their proper and peculiar work. They look so far away, and sohigh up, for a missionary field, that they overlook the work that isalready waiting for them just at their feet. Thus, while professing tobe eager for labor, they are standing in the market-place, “all the dayidle.”[_April 22._]FINDING AND BRINGING.In spiritual activity, as in all other matters, it is a good ruleto begin at the beginning. How many, in trying to learn some of thesciences—say geology, for example—have disdained the use of hand-booksfor the mastering of the elements, and, plunging at once into someelaborate treatise, which presupposed familiar acquaintance with therudiments, have felt themselves unable to understand it, and havethrown up the whole study in disgust! Now, it is just thus many do inChristian work. They begin at the wrong place, and so they speedilybecome discouraged. Work from the center out, and the radii of yourinfluence will go out to every point of the circumference; but if,leaving your own proper center, you take your station somewhere on thecircumference, your labor will produce very little result. Now, home isthe center of every man’s sphere; and it is there he must begin to workfor Jesus. Let the husband begin with the wife, and the wife with thehusband; the parents with the children; and the children, where needis, lovingly and humbly, with the parents; the brother with his sister;and the sister with her brother. Then, when the home sphere is filledup, let your life’s influence flow over, and seek to benefit those withwhom you are coming into daily business contact. Thus the branches ofyour vine will “run over the wall,” and your sphere will widen everwith your endeavors.“Oh yes!” you will say to me, “that may be all very true. But it isfar more difficult thus to begin at home than to commence abroad. Iwould rather teach a class in the mission-school than to speak to myown family about Jesus. I would almost sooner address a meeting thanmake a private appeal to my brother or my sister.” But why is this?Surely it can not be because you love those who are nearest to you lessthan you do those who are farther away! Can it be because you wouldget more prominence and honor among men, by working abroad, than youcould secure by laboring at home? Or is it because you are consciousthat your home conduct would destroy the influence of any teachingson which you might venture there? You know best. But whatever be itscause, let me beseech you to revise your whole procedure, and makehome the headquarters of your effort. Can it be that there are here awife and husband who have never had one hour of heart communion witheach other on this all-important matter? If there be, may God himselfin some way break that silence that has sealed their tongues; and letus all rest assured that the truest revival of religion will be gainedwhen our church members are resolved to test what shall be the resultof beginning to labor thus for Christ at home.We are making far too little in these days of the Church in thehouse. We are waiting for our children to be converted by outsideinfluences, when, if we were to look at the matter rightly, it shouldbe our ambition to be ourselves the leaders of our sons and daughtersto the Lord. Some years ago I read an account of the manner in whicha cold church was stirred into warmth and vitality; and as it bearsdirectly on the point to which I am now referring, I will take theliberty of introducing it here. At one of the conference meetings, asimple man, not remarkable for fluency or correctness of speech, madean appeal something to the following effect: “I feel, brethren, realbad about the people who don’t love the Lord Jesus Christ here in ourown neighborhood. We’re not as we ought to be, that’s very certain,but it’s hard work rowing against the stream. We find that out when wetalk to men about religion on Sunday who haven’t any religion all theweek. They don’t mind us. And just so with the young folks. Their mindsall seem running one way. Now, what’s to be done? Not much with thegrown folks, for they aren’t controlled by us, and we can only drop aword now and then, and pray for them. But here’s our own children. Ihave four boys, and only one of them comes to the communion with hismother and me. And I don’t think I have done my duty to those youngerboys. They love me, and God knows I love them; but I kind o’ hate tospeak to them about religion. But rather than see them go fartherwithout my Jesus for their Jesus, I’m going to ask them to join him.I’m going to pray with them; and if I can’t tell them all they want toknow, why, our minister can. Brethren, I’m going to try to turn thestream for my boys. Home is the head of the river. I mean to beginto-night. Won’t some father do like me with his boys, and give me hisword out?” Scarcely had he seated himself, when, one after another,some thirty people pledged themselves, saying, “I’ll do the same at myhouse;” and the pledge was kept. In a short time the minister’s laborsbegan to tell as they had never done before. The influence spread, butthere was no excitement. On the occasion of the communion service,from family after family, one and another came to enroll themselvesamong the followers of Jesus, and nearly every one that came was undertwenty-five years of age. So, through revived home effort, the workof God was stimulated both in the church and in the neighborhood. Myfriends, this witness is true, “Home is the head of the river.” Isthere no one here to-night who will join in the resolution made bythat earnest man, and say, “By the grace of God I’ll do the same at myhouse?”Notice, finally, that in following this plan of working for Christ wemay, all unconsciously to ourselves, be the means of introducing toJesus one who will be of far more service than ever we could have been.It was Simon Peter whom Andrew brought to Christ. We do not hear muchin the New Testament of Andrew’s after-history, but if he had neverdone anything else than lead his brother to the Lord, it was worthliving for just to do that; and when we get to heaven, we shall seethat the lustre of Peter’s crown casts special radiance on Andrew’sface. When we read of the conversions on the Day of Pentecost; of theheroic protest before the council; of the conversion of Cornelius; andabove all, when we peruse those two precious letters which Peter hasindited, let us not forget that, humanly speaking, but for Andrew,Peter would not have been himself a Christian. Doubtless, God couldhave called him by some other instrumentality, but he made use ofAndrew to teach us the lesson that, in doing the good that lies at ourhands, we may at length really do more for the Church than we couldhave effected by more ostentatious effort in other places. Let thelowly and timid, therefore, take courage. They may not have shiningtalents or commanding position, yet by working where they are they maybe honored in bringing to Jesus some who shall take foremost placesin the Church, or become leaders in some missionary or evangelisticmovement.Many of the greatest men the Church has known have been convertedthrough the agency of individuals all but unknown. A humble dissentingminister, whose name was scarcely heard of a few miles from hismanse, was honored to be of signal service to Thomas Chalmers in thecrisis-hour of his history; and I have heard Mr. Spurgeon tell how hewas led to the Lord by a sermon preached by an unlettered man in aPrimitive Methodist chapel.Some of the greatest theologians the Church has ever seen, and someof the most useful ministers who have ever lived, have been made andmolded by so common a thing as a mother’s influence. Robert Pollok,whose “Course of Time” used to be a household book throughout Scotland,said once of his poem, “It has my mother’s divinity in it.” Mother,will you take note of that? Many a time you have regretted that youcould not take part in any public work for Christ, by reason of thebond that held you to your boy. Regret no more, but bring that boy toChrist, and he will live to do his own work and his mother’s too; andwhen the crown is placed upon his head its diamonds will flash newglory upon your countenance.The sum of what we have been saying, then, is this: that each of usshould begin to do all that he can, where he is, for Christ. But ifwe would succeed in that effort, we must be sure that we have alreadyfound him for ourselves. A minister had preached a simple sermon uponthe text, “He brought him to Jesus;” and as he was going home, hisdaughter, walking by his side, began to speak of what she had beenhearing. She said, “I did so like that sermon.” “Well,” inquired herfather, “whom are you going to bring to Jesus?” A thoughtful expressioncame over her countenance as she replied, “I think, papa, that I willjust bring myself to him.” “Capital!” said her father, “that will doadmirably for a beginning.” This, brethren, is the true starting-point.We must be good, if we would do good. Bring yourselves to Jesus,therefore; and, as iron by being rubbed upon a magnet, becomes itselfmagnetic, so you, being united to Christ, will become partakers in hisattractive power, and will draw men with “the cords of a man,” whichare also “the bands of love.”[_April 29._]FAITH THE SOLE SAVING ACT.By WILLIAM G. T. SHEDD, D.D.In asking their question, the Jews intended to inquire of Christwhat particular things they must do, before all others, in order toplease God. The “works of God,” as they denominate them, were not anyand every duty, but those more special and important acts, by whichthe creature might secure the Divine approval and favor. Our Lordunderstood their question in this sense, and in his reply tells them,that the great and only work for them to do was to exercise faith inhim. They had employed the plural number in their question; but inhis answer he employs the singular. They had asked, “What shall we dothat we might work the works of God,” as if there were several of them.His reply is, “This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom hehath sent.” He narrows down the terms of salvation to a single one;and makes the destiny of the soul to depend upon the performance of aparticular individual act. In this, as in many other incidental ways,our Lord teaches his own divinity. If he were a mere creature; if hewere only an inspired teacher like David or Paul; how would he dare,when asked to give in a single word the condition and means of humansalvation, to say that they consist in resting the soul upon him? WouldDavid have dared to say: “This is the work of God,—this is the savingact,—that ye believe in me?” Would Paul have presumed to say to theanxious inquirer: “Your soul is safe, if you trust in me?” But Christmakes this declaration, without any qualification. Yet he was meek andlowly of heart, and never assumed an honor or a prerogative that didnot belong to him. It is only upon the supposition that he was “veryGod of very God,” the Divine Redeemer of the children of men, that wecan justify such an answer to such a question.The belief is spontaneous and natural to man, that something must bedone in order to salvation. No man expects to reach heaven by inaction.Even the indifferent and supine soul expects to rouse itself up atsome future time, and work out its salvation. The most thoughtlessand inactive man, in religious respects, will acknowledge thatthoughtlessness and inactivity if continued will end in perdition. Buthe intends at a future day to think, and act, and be saved. So naturalis it, to every man, to believe in salvation by works; so ready isevery one to conceive that heaven is reached, and hell is escaped, onlyby an earnest effort of some kind; so natural is it to every man to askwith these Jews, “What shall we do, that we may work the works of God?”But mankind generally, like the Jews in the days of our Lord, are undera delusion respecting the nature of the work which must be performed inorder to salvation. And in order to understand this delusion, we mustfirst examine the common notion upon the subject.When a man begins to think of God, and of his own relations to him,he finds that he owes him service and obedience. He has a work toperform, as a subject of the Divine government; and this work is toobey the Divine law. He finds himself obligated to love God with allhis heart, and his neighbor as himself, and to discharge all the dutiesthat spring out of his relations to God and man. He perceives thatthis is the “work” given him to do by creation, and that if he doesit he will attain the true end of his existence and be happy in timeand eternity. When therefore he begins to think of a religious life,his first spontaneous impulse is to begin the performance of this workwhich he has hitherto neglected, and to reinstate himself in the Divinefavor by the ordinary method of keeping the law of God. He perceivesthat this is the mode in which the angels preserve themselves holyand happy: that this is the original mode appointed by God, when heestablished the covenant of works; and he does not see why it is notthe method for him. The law expressly affirms that the man that doeththese things shall live by them; he proposes to take the law justas it reads, and just as it stands,—to do the deeds of the law, toperform the works which it enjoins, and to live by the service. Thiswe say, is the common notion, natural to man, of the species of workwhich must be performed in order to eternal life. This was the ideawhich filled the mind of the Jews when they put the question of thetext, and received for answer from Christ, “This is the work of God,that ye believe on him whom he hath sent.” Our Lord does not draw outthe whole truth, in detail. He gives only the positive part of theanswer, leaving his hearers to infer the negative part of it. For thewhole doctrine of Christ, fully stated, would run thus: “No work ofthe kind of which you are thinking can save you; no obedience of thelaw, ceremonial or moral, can reinstate you in right relations to God.I do not summon you to the performance of any such service as thatwhich you have in mind, in order to your justification and acceptancebefore the Divine tribunal. This is the work of God,—this is the soleand single act which you are to perform,—namely, that you believe onhim whom he hath sent as a propitiation for sin. I do not summon you toworks of the law, but to faith in me, the Redeemer. Your first duty isnot to attempt to acquire a righteousness in the old method, by doingsomething of yourselves, but to receive a righteousness in the newmethod, by trusting in what another has done for you.”I. What is the ground and reason of such an answer as this? Why is maninvited to the method of faith in another, instead of the method offaith in himself? Why is not his first spontaneous thought the trueone? Why should he not obtain eternal life by resolutely proceeding todo his duty, and keeping the law of God? Why can he not be saved by thelaw of works? Why is he so summarily shut up to the law of faith?We answer: Because it is too late for him to adopt the method ofsalvation by works. The law is indeed explicit in its assertion,that the man that doeth these things shall live by them; but then itsupposes that the man begin at the beginning. A subject of governmentcan not disobey a civil statute for five or ten years, and then puthimself in right relations to it again, by obeying it for the remainderof his life. Can a man who has been a thief or an adulterer for twentyyears, and then practices honesty and purity for the following thirtyyears, stand up before the seventh and eighth commandments and beacquitted by them? It is too late for any being who has violated a laweven in a single instance, to attempt to be justified by that law. For,the law demands and supposes that obedience begin at the very beginningof existence, and continue down uninterruptedly to the end of it. Noman can come in at the middle of a process of obedience, any more thanhe can come in at the last end of it, if he proposes to be acceptedupon the ground of obedience. “I testify,” says St. Paul, “to every manthat is circumcised, that he is a debtor to do the whole law” (Gal.v: 3). The whole, or none, is the just and inexorable rule which lawlays down in the matter of justification. If any subject of the Divinegovernment can show a clean record, from the beginning to the end ofhis existence, the statute says to him, “Well done,” and gives him thereward which he has earned. And it gives it to him not as a matter ofgrace, but of debt. The law never makes a present of wages. It neverpays out wages, until they are earned,—fairly and fully earned. Butwhen a perfect obedience from first to last is rendered to its claims,the compensation follows as matter of debt. The law, in this instance,is itself brought under obligation. It owes a reward to the perfectlyobedient subject of law, and it considers itself his debtor until it ispaid. “Now to him that worketh, is the reward not reckoned of grace,but of debt. If it be of works, then it is no more grace: otherwisework is no more work.”    [_End of Required Reading for April._]       *       *       *       *       *TRANSLATION.—A Welsh curate having preached several sermons which wereconsidered superior to his own powers of composition, was asked by afriend how he managed? He replied: “Do you see, I have got a volume ofsermons by one Tillotson, and a very good book it is; so I translateone of the sermons into Welsh, and then back again into English; afterwhich the devil himself would not know it again.”THEY GROW TO FLOWERS, OR TO WEEDS.THE TRUE GENTLEMAN.    ’Tis he whose very thought and deed      By rule of virtue moves;    Whose generous tongue disdains to speak      The thing his heart disproves.    Who never did a slander forge,      His neighbour’s fame to wound;    Nor hearken to a false report,      By malice whispered round.    Who vice, in all its pomp and power,      Can treat with just neglect;    And piety, though clothed in rags,      Religiously respect.    Who to his plighted word and trust      Has ever firmly stood;    And, though he promise to his loss,      He makes his promise good.    Whose soul in usury disdains      His treasure to employ;    Whom no reward can ever bribe      The guiltless to destroy.Be honest. Not only because “honesty is the best policy,” but becauseit is a duty to God and man. The heart that can be gratified bydishonest gains; the ambition that can be satisfied by dishonest means;the mind that can be devoted to dishonest purposes, must be of theworst order.Having laid down these general principles for the government ofpersonal conduct, we will epitomize what we would still enforce;—Avoid idleness—it is the parent of many evils. Can you pray, “Give usthis day our daily bread,” and not hear the reply, “Do thou this daythy daily duty?”Avoid telling idle tales, which is like firing arrows into the dark;you know not into whose heart they may fall.Avoid talking about yourself; praising your own works; and proclaimingyour own deeds. If they are good, they will proclaim themselves; ifbad, the less you say of them the better.Avoid envy, for it cannot benefit you, nor can it injure those againstwhom it is cherished.Avoid disputation, for the mere sake of argument. The man who disputesobstinately and in a bigoted spirit, is like the man who would stop thefountain from which he should drink. Earnest discussion is commendable;but factious argument never yet produced a good result.Be kind in little things. The true generosity of the heart is moredisplayed by deeds of minor kindness, than by acts which may partake ofostentation.Be polite. Politeness is the poetry of conduct—and like poetry it hasmany qualities. Let not your politeness be too florid, but of thatgentle kind which indicates refined nature.Be sociable—avoid reserve in society. Remember that the socialelements, like the air we breathe, are purified by motion. Thoughtillumines thought, and smiles win smiles.Be punctual. One minute too late has lost many a golden opportunity.Besides which, the want of punctuality is an affront offered to theperson to whom your presence is due.The foregoing remarks may be said to apply to the moral conduct, ratherthan to the details of personal manners. Great principles, however,suggest minor ones; and hence from the principles laid down many hintson personal behavior may be gathered.Be hearty in your salutations.Discreet and sincere in your friendships.Like to listen rather than to talk.Behave, even in the presence of your relations, as though you feltrespect to be due to them.In society never forget that you are but one of many.When you visit a friend, conform to the rules of his home.Lean not upon his tables, nor rub your feet against his chairs.Pry not into letters that are not your own.Pay unmistakable respect to ladies everywhere.Beware of foppery and of silly flirtation.In public places be not too pertinacious of your own rights.Find pleasure in making concessions.Speak distinctly.Look at the person to whom you speak.When you have spoken, give him an opportunity to reply.Avoid drunkenness as you would a curse; and modify all appetites,especially those that are acquired.Dress well, but not superfluously.Be neither like a sloven, nor like a stuffed model.Keep away all uncleanly appearances from the person. Let the nails,the teeth, and, in fact, the whole system receive _salutary_ ratherthan _studied_ care. But let these things receive attention at thetoilet—not elsewhere.Avoid displaying excess of jewelry. Nothing looks more effeminate upona man.Every one of these suggestions may be regarded as the center of manyothers, which the earnest mind cannot fail to discover.HABITS OF A MAN OF BUSINESS.A sacred regard to the principles of justice forms the basis of everytransaction, and regulates the conduct of the upright man of business.He is strict in keeping his engagements.Does nothing carelessly nor in a hurry.Employs nobody to do what he can easily do himself.Keeps everything in its proper place.Leaves nothing undone that ought to be done, and which circumstancespermit him to do.Keeps his designs and business from the view of others.Is prompt and decisive with his customers, and does not over-trade hiscapital.Prefers short credits to long ones; and cash to credit at all times,either in buying or selling; and small profits in credit cases, withlittle risk to the chance of better gains with more hazard.He is clear and explicit in all his bargains.Leaves nothing of consequence to memory which he can and ought tocommit to writing.Keeps copies of all his important letters which he sends away, and hasevery letter, invoice, etc., relating to his business, titled, classed,and put away.Never suffers his desk to be confused by many papers lying upon it.Is always at the head of his business, well knowing that if he leavesit, it will leave him.Holds it as a maxim that he whose credit is suspected is not one to betrusted.Is constantly examining his books, and sees through all his affairs asfar as care and attention will enable him.Balances regularly at stated times, and then makes out and transmitsall his accounts current to his customers, both at home and abroad.Avoids as much as possible all sorts of accommodation in money mattersand lawsuits where there is the least hazard.He is economical in his expenditures, always living within his income.Keeps a memorandum-book in his pocket, in which he notes everyparticular relative to appointments, addresses, and petty cash matters.Is cautious how he becomes security for any person; and is generouswhen urged by motives of humanity.Let a man act strictly to these habits; when once begun they will beeasy to continue in—ever remembering that he hath no profits by hispains whom Providence doth not prosper—and success will attend hisefforts.HABIT OF TAKING PAINS.By JAMES KERR, M. A.Who can doubt that the habit of taking pains, the habit of minuteattention, of patient thought and persevering study, is one of theleading characteristics of genius! To this rule there seems to be noexception.We see it illustrated in the lives of our greatest thinkers. Did agenius like Lord Bacon compose his immortal works with ease, and, asit were, without effort? Far from it. On the contrary, he took greatpains. They were written and re-written. They were the fruit of muchpatient thought, of repeated revision and persistent effort. Thus, weare told that he transcribed his “Novum Organum” twelve times withhis own hand, each time revising it carefully. He was employed onthis great work at intervals for a period of thirty years. When hetranscribed it he did not merely recopy what he had written, with a fewverbal alterations only, but changed it in substance, so as to bring itnearer the model in his own mind. This was his constant practice, as weknow from his own words. Writing to a friend, he says—“My great workgoeth forward, and, after my manner, I alter even when I add; so thatnothing is finished till all be finished.”Who is there among us who would have the patience to write any literaryproduction in which he might be engaged twelve times over with hisown hand! Think, too, of the patient thought that must have beenbestowed on the work each time it was transcribed! If Bacon’s genius isimmensely greater than what any of us can boast of, do not his patientthought, his persevering study, his habit of taking pains, exceed oursin the same proportion!Bacon’s precept corresponded to his practice. How does the great authorof the inductive method direct us to make discoveries? Not by volatileflights of fancy, but by patient labor. We are patiently to observe andmake experiments. We are to collect all sorts of facts which have anybearing on the subject, not even neglecting what may appear trifles. Weare to arrange them under proper heads. We are to examine them underevery aspect, and reflect upon them with deepest thought. Thus only, hetells us, will discoveries be made worthy of the name.Let us turn to another great philosopher of our own country. How didNewton succeed in making his name immortal? The poet says of him—    “Nature and nature’s laws lay hid in night,     God said—Let Newton be, and there was light.”Yet it was not without effort and painstaking care that he madehis discoveries. The laws of light and gravitation did not revealthemselves to him at a glance. The process of discovery was muchslower. Let us go to the man himself and learn the secret of hissuccess. He tells us that he made his discoveries by _always thinking_about them. This patient thought, this persevering study, thispainstaking care, enabled him at last to succeed where others failed.This it was, and not mere genius alone, that shed a luster on his name,which shall last so long as the sun and the moon endure.To come nearer our own times and to men of less dazzling fame. GeorgeStephenson, the inventor, we may say, of railways, will be allowedto have been a great mechanical genius. The lesson we learn from hislife is to take pains and persevere. His inventions were, in no smalldegree, the result of careful study. We see the pains he took toacquaint himself with every detail as to the habits of “the engine”while still a brakesman. He thus laid the foundation of his futuresuccess in applying the steam-engine to the railway. We read, also,that when he retired for the night, it was not always to sink intoslumber. He worked out many a difficult problem in bed, and for hourshe would lie awake and turn over in his mind, with painstaking care andpatient thought, how to overcome some mechanical obstacle that stood inhis way.In the later years of his life, when railways had spread over thekingdom, he was fond of pointing out to others the difficulties he hadto surmount, and what pains and perseverance had brought him to. It wasnot talent, it was not genius, in the ordinary sense of the word, towhich he attributed his success; it was to perseverance. In addressingyoung men his grand text was “persevere,” and on this theme the oldman grew eloquent, glowing with the recollections of his own personalexperience.Hugh Miller was another man of undoubted genius. When we contemplatesuch a man rising to distinction both in science and literature, inspite of the most adverse circumstances, we are apt to think that hemust have been indebted to the native vigor of his mind alone, withoutthe aid of any extraneous advantages. But what do we find to be thecase? No one can peruse his works without perceiving that he was agreat reader, and that the thoughts of others supplied the food onwhich his mind grew. Like Dr. Johnson, he was a robust genius, capableof grappling with whole libraries. He seems, while yet unknown tofame, to have ransacked our whole literature, quarrying his way intomany hidden recesses not generally explored. Even classical works,translated into English, he read with avidity. He says himself—“I haveread Cowper’s ‘Homer’ and Dryden’s ‘Virgil’ again and again, and drunkin all their beauties.”This appetite for reading commenced at an early age. When a lad abouttwelve he got access to a small library belonging to one of hisneighbors, and was allowed freely to peruse its contents. He says,casting a glance back to these times:—“I read incessantly; and, as theappetite for reading becomes stronger the more it is indulged, I felt,when I had consumed the whole, a still keener craving than before.”By these steps he rose to eminence. He thus became a distinguishedman. His mind was enriched by much reading. It received a trainingwhich qualified him in future years to become a geologist of the firstrank, to write on scientific subjects in a style of rare beauty, sopicturesque and expressive that men of distinguished parts have saidthey would give their “left hand” if they could only imitate it, and,in a word, to handle skilfully any subject to which he turned hisattention, not excepting just and delicate criticism on some of ourless known poets.Among men of science there are few, if any, whose writings have madea greater impression on the present generation than those of CharlesDarwin. How were his works produced? Not by fits and starts. Not byflights of fancy. He is penetrated by the true scientific spirit, andsteadily pursues his object for years, patiently accumulating facts,and by their light drawing conclusions in which, though men may differon some points, there will always be found large portions of solidtruth. Let us see, for example, how his remarkable book on the “Originof Species” was produced. It was not struck out at a blow, but was thelabor of years and of much patient thought. He himself says of it:—“Onmy return home it occurred to me, in 1837, that something might perhapsbe made out on this question by patiently accumulating and reflectingon all sorts of facts which could possibly have any bearing upon it.”He steadily pursued his object from that time, for more than twentyyears, and then his work was published to the world.This is the way in which great works on science are produced. Theauthor takes great pains. He steadily pursues his object for years,with patient thought and unremitting attention, leaving no stoneunturned. It is this that accomplishes great things, and not mereflight of untutored genius.It is needless to say that his latest work, on the modest subject ofearth-worms, exhibits the same painstaking care, the same laboriousstudy, and the same patient accumulation of facts.Hitherto the examples adduced have been more of a scientific thanliterary character. If, leaving science, we take a glance at generalliterature, it will be found that those also who come to the frontas writers in this branch of learning are, without exception,distinguished by their habit of taking pains with the subject in hand.Were the writings of the brilliant Macaulay the outpourings of puregenius, unaided by painstaking labor and diligent study? Far from it.When he wrote on any subject he was unwearied in his researches. Noamount of labor appalled him. Even when husbanding his resources, andengaged in no particular literary task, he read continually, laying ina store for future use. To read was his passion and delight. It was hissolace under all circumstances. It cheered him in his Indian exile. Inturning over the pages of his life we are absolutely struck with aweat his insatiable appetite for books. It would be difficult to find anexample of anyone in these modern times whose reading, especially inthe Greek and Roman classics, took so wide a range. He read, not onlyin his study, but in his long walks he had always a book with him,which he read incessantly.Nothing is said in his life of his habits of composition, but therecan be little doubt that his clear and vigorous style was not formedwithout much study and practice. In addition to his admirable prosestyle, he had great facility in writing verses. How did he acquireit? By long continued practice. He says, in a letter to one of hissisters:—“As you like my verses, I will some day or other write youa whole rhyming letter. I wonder whether any other man ever wrotedoggerel so easily. I run it off just as fast as my pen can move. Thiscomes of a schoolboy habit of writing verses all day long.”Of our modern prose writers, there are few whose writings are more easyto read than those of Charles Dickens. They look like the spontaneousoutpourings of genius, flowing freely from his pen without effort.And yet, in point of fact, he took great pains with what he wrote.When engaged on “Little Dorrit” he jots down these words in hisjournal:—“Now to work again. The story lies before me strong and clear.Not to be easily told; for nothing of that kind is to be easily donethat I know of.”Then, in another direction, look at the pains he took in preparinghis “Readings” for the public. He learned them all by heart, so as tohave no mechanical drawback in looking after the words. He was alsoat great pains to correct his pronunciation, and cultivate the habitof self-possession. As the reputation of these “Readings” widened, hewas ambitious that they should grow better and better. When engagedin giving a series of readings, he used to repeat them to himself,often twice a day, and with exactly the same pains as at night whenbefore his audience. He felt that nothing could be done well, that nogreat perfection could be reached, without taking pains. We are herereminded of Mrs. Siddons, who played the character of Lady Macbethfor thirty years. Such was her solicitude to act the part well, thatshe invariably read over the play, once more, on the morning of theperformance, and with such care as always to discover something new inthe character which she had not observed before.       *       *       *       *       *Whoso acts a hundred times with high moral principle before hespeaks once of it, that is a man whom one could bless and clasp toone’s heart. I am far from saying that he is on that account freefrom faults, but the _plus et minus_, the degree of striving afterperfection and virtue, determines the value of the man.—_GeorgeForster._A CHAPLET OF PEARLS.By WILLIAM JONES, F.S.A.There is a magic charm in the pearl that seems to have fascinated theworld in various countries. The modest splendor and purity of the jewelmade it the favorite of all others among the Orientals.[J] Chares, ofMitylene, alludes to the Margaritæ necklaces as far more highly valuedby the Asiatics than those made of gold. The Romans went wild overthem, and of all the articles of luxury and ostentation known to them,pearls appear to have been most esteemed. Pompey, as the richest spoilsof his victories in Asia, displayed in his procession into Rome, afterhis triumph over the third continent, among his treasures, thirty-threecrowns made of pearls, a temple of the Muses with a dial on the top,and a figure of himself, formed of the same materials. This rousedthe ire of the stoic Pliny, but contributed to the popular passionfor obtaining these jewels. He remarks of Lollia Paulina (wife of theEmperor Caligula) that she was covered with emeralds and pearls, strungalternately, glittering all over her head, hair, bandeau, necklaces,and fingers, valued at forty millions of sesterces (£400,000).Servilia, the mother of the famous Brutus, received from Julius Cæsar apearl as a present which cost the donor £50,000. The celebrated pearlsof Cleopatra, worn as earrings, were valued at £161,457.Some consider bdellium, which is mentioned in the Scriptures (Genesisand Numbers), as a precious stone, and the Jewish rabbins, togetherwith some modern commentators, translate it by _pearl_, but it is morethan probable that the pearl was unknown in the time of Moses. Mostprobably, the Hebrew _bedolach_ is the aromatic gum bdellium, whichissues from a tree growing in Arabia, Media, and the Indies.According to the poetic Orientals, every year, on the sixteenth day ofthe month of Nisan, the pearl-oysters rise to the sea and open theirshells, in order to receive the rain which falls at that time, andthe drops thus caught become pearls. On this belief the poet Sadi, inhis “Bostau,” has the following fable: “A drop of water fell one dayfrom a cloud into the sea. Ashamed and confused at finding itself insuch an immensity of water, it exclaimed, ‘What am I in comparison ofthis vast ocean? My existence is less than nothing in this boundlessabyss!’ While it thus discoursed of itself, a pearl-shell received itin its bosom, and fortune so favored it that it became a magnificentand precious pearl, worthy of adorning the diadem of kings. Thus wasits humility the cause of its elevation, and by annihilating itself, itmerited exaltation.”Moore alludes to this pretty fiction in one of his sweetest melodies:    “And precious the tear as that rain from the sky     Which turns into pearls as it falls in the sea.”Sir Walter Scott, in the “Bridal of Triermain,” says:    “See these pearls that long have slept;     These were tears by Naiads wept.”Lilly, in “Gallathea:”    “Is any cozen’d of a teare     Which (as a pearle) disdaine does weare?”Shakspere (“Richard III.”):    “The liquid drops of tears that you have shed     Shall come again, transform’d to orient pearl,     Advantaging their loan with interest     Of ten-times-double gain of happiness.”In Lee’s “Mithridates” we have:    “’Twould raise your pity, but to see the tears     Force through her snowy lids their melting course,     To lodge themselves on her red murmuring lips     That talk such mournful things; when straight a gale     Of startling sighs carry those pearls away,     As dews by winds are wafted from the flowers.”Elena Piscopia (1684), of the Corraro family of Venice, had a medalstruck in her honor, on the reverse of which is an open shell,receiving the drops of dew from heaven, which form into pearls: themotto was _Rore divino_—by the divine dew.Pearls have for ages been significant for tears. It is related thatQueen Margaret Tudor, consort of James IV. of Scotland, previous to thebattle of Flodden Field, had strong presentiments of the disastrousissue of that conflict. One night she had fearful dreams, in which shethought she saw her husband hurled down a great precipice and crushedand mangled at the bottom. In another vision she thought, as she waslooking at her jewels, chains, and sparkling coronets of diamonds, theysuddenly turned into pearls, “which are the emblems of widowhood andtears.”A few nights before the assassination of Henry IV. of France, his queendreamed that all the jewels in her crown were changed into pearls, andshe was told that they were significant of tears.Milton, in his “Epitaph on the Marchioness of Winchester,” says:    “And those pearls of dew she wears     Prove to be presaging tears.”Similes of pearls and tears are frequent in our old writers. ThusShakspere in “Midsummer Night’s Dream:”    “And that same dew which sometimes on the buds     Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,     Stood now within the pretty floweret’s eyes,     Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.”In “King John:”    “Draw those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes     Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;     Ay, with those crystal beads heaven shall be bribed     To do him justice and revenge on you.”The metaphor is a favorite one with Lovelace:    “Lucasta wept, and still the bright       Enamor’d god of day,     With his soft handkerchief of light,       Kiss’d the wet pearls away.”And—    “If tears could wash the ill away,     A pearl for each wet bead I’d pay.”In Chalkhill’s “Thealma and Clearchus,” we find of the former:                “Anon she drops a tear,    That stole along her cheeks, and falling down,    Into a pearl it freezeth with her frown.”Robert Southwell, in “St. Mary Magdalen’s Tears,” says: “The angelsmust bathe themselves in the pure stream of thine eyes, and thy faceshall be set with this pearly liquid, that, as out of thy tears werestroken the first sparks of thy Lord’s love, so thy tears may be theoil to feed his flames.”THE WORTH OF FRESH AIR.Your neighbor, John Stedman, is set fast with aches and pains, and isvery ill. You have just been to see him, you say, and you can not thinkwhy it is that people are every now and then attacked in this way withsickness. You have been told that God sends disease; but for your ownpart you can not understand why it is that some of your neighbors,who, like John Stedman, seem to be the most honest and deserving, getthe largest share of it. I think, my industrious friend, I can perhapshelp you to the explanation of the riddle. At any rate, there are manythings touching upon this very subject, which as an old acquaintance,and one who has learned through long intimacy to take great interestin all that concerns you, I have for some time desired to say. I shallnow seize this opportunity to make a beginning, and shall seat myselfcomfortably that I may chat with you more at my ease. Pray do nottrouble yourself to move anything. This empty chair near the door willdo excellently well for me. I know you will listen to me with attentionand patience, first for old friendship’s sake, and then because youwill very soon feel that what I do say is intended frankly and solelyfor your good.You have a fine, smart-looking clock, I see, ticking away thereopposite. But the old fellow can hardly be so correct as he seems; hishands point to eight, although the day wants but a couple of hours ofnoon. I fear there must be something wrong about him, notwithstandinghis looking so vastly well in the face.You say you can not make the clock keep time. You wind it up carefullyevery Saturday, and set it correctly, and yet before the next Saturdaycomes round, it has either lagged hours behind, or it has galloped onhours too fast. It goes as if it were moved by the uncertain wind,instead of being driven by regular machinery, and it was a shame forthe man to sell you such a bad-going thing. If the clock never didbehave itself any better, you are right in this: but perhaps you aretoo hasty in finding fault with the maker; he may not altogetherdeserve the blame. Let us just open the door of the case, and peep atthe inner workmanship, and see whether we can not discover some causefor the irregular performance.What is this? As soon as I open this little door I stumble uponsomething that looks rather suspicious; it is a quantity of light flue,and hair, and dust, mingled together. The clockmaker never put thatinto the case. Then, observe how every wheel and pinion is soiled withdirt, and every crevice and corner is choked up with filth. It reallywould be a very wonderful thing if the wheels did move regularly. Thesecret of the bad working of your clock is, simply, that you have notknown how to take care of it, and use it fairly. I dare say it wentvery well when it was turned out of its maker’s hands, but he nevermeant it to be in the state in which it now is. You must send it backto him, and get him to clean the works and oil the wheels, and thenyou must try whether you can not prevent it from getting into such saddisorder again.Now, your neighbor yonder with his aches and pains and his sickness,are you sure that he is not in very much the same predicament as thisclock? If we could look into the works of his body, are you confidentthat we should not find them choked up and uncared for, instead ofbeing in the condition in which they were intended to be? His aches andpains, are they not the grating and complaining of deranged and cloggedmachinery? I am quite aware that sick people generally are not sensibleof having allowed anything to come near to their bodies which theyought to have kept away. But neither did you know that dirt was gettingto the works of your clock, although we discovered it there in suchplenty. The dust and dirt which collected there, first flew about inthe air, scattered so thinly and lightly that you could not see them.So, too, other things which you can not see may have been floating ingreat abundance around you, some of them being to the living frame whatdirt and dust are to clockwork. That there are such invisible thingsfloating around living creatures, and that some of these clog andderange the working of their frames, I think I shall have no difficultyin showing you. I hope I shall also be able to point out to you, thatmany of them may be discovered, although they can not be seen, and maybe driven away or avoided.That wonderful object which you call your _body_, is actually a machinelike the clock, contrived and put together for a certain service. Ithas for its works, muscles and bones, and blood vessels and nerves.These works have been most beautifully fitted and adjusted: indeed,they are the workmanship of a skill which can not fail. The maker ofyour body is the great and unerring Power, who has also made all therest of creation. It is God.God made your body with supple joints and free limbs; with strongmuscles and ready nerves. The machine was perfect when it came fromhis hands. It was then capable of going better than the best clockthat was ever constructed by human ingenuity. It was able even tocleanse, and oil, and repair itself, and it was prepared to continueits orderly movements, without suffering the slightest derangement, forsixty or seventy long years. But when God placed this perfected pieceof delicate workmanship at your disposal, he, like the clockmaker withhis clock, required that you should at least take care of it, and useit fairly. If, however, you do not do this, then as with the clock, sowill it be with your body. If you keep it amid dust and dirt, no otherresult can come but the clogging of its works, and the derangement oftheir movements. Out of that dusty old clock-case it is my purpose todraw this very surprising and important lesson in your behoof. Whenevermen get out of happiness and ease into wretchedness and disease, it isalmost sure to be their own fault, and the consequence of their owndoings. Either they perversely and wilfully do something which theyknow very well they ought not to do, or they do something which theyought not to do, in ignorance.Comfort and ease are to body and mind, what steady and even movementsare to clock-work—signs that the machinery is in perfect order.Discomfort and _dis-ease_ (_absence of ease_) are to body and mindwhat fitful and irregular movements are to clock-work;—signs thatthe machinery is clogged and in disorder. You are always inclined torebel against discomfort and pain. Never give way to this inclination.Discomfort and pain are friendly monitors, that come to you to performa kind service. They come to warn you that there is something wrong inand around your own body, which requires to be set right.You will observe that I have said men _nearly_ always have themselvesto blame when they get out of health and into disease. I have saidnearly always, because it occasionally does happen that the sufferingis not immediately caused by the sufferer’s own wrong doing. This, forinstance, is the case when a child has a constitutional disease, whichhas been communicated to it by a parent. It is, however, even in theseinstances none the less true, that _human blindness or wilfulness_leads to the mischief, and this is really the practical point that I amdesirous you should see. These are the cases in which, in accordancewith God’s law, “the sins of the fathers are visited upon thechildren.” The parents have done wrong, and the offspring have to paythe penalty. The line of obvious duty, however, is in no way alteredhere. If a man suffers because his parents did what was wrong, thisreally is an additional reason why he ought never to do that which maycause his own children to suffer, in like manner, with himself.There is this further proof, that even in these cases it really is_man’s wrong doing which leads to human suffering_. When the childrenof parents who have done what was wrong, go on doing only what is rightthrough several generations, their offspring at last cease to suffer,and become altogether healthy and sound. The burden of the fathers’sins is then, at length, mercifully taken off from their shoulders.Having listened patiently to this little sermon, you would now likeme to come to the point, and show you some of the dust and dirt whichare scattered around the living body, and which at times get into themachinery to the damage of its working. First of all, in my endeavor todo this, I should like to make you quite comprehend the possibility ofthere being very weighty matters pressing close round you, which younevertheless are entirely unable to see, even in bright daylight. Justcome out with me, here, upon the road. How pleasant and fresh the dayis! Do you not feel the gentle breeze fanning your cheek as you turn upthe lane? Yet you can not see the breeze! What is it, then? Certainlyit is _something_, for it touches and even presses against your skin.But it is something, too, which has weight and power of its own.Observe how it shakes the leaves of the trees as it sweeps past them.It is, as you know, the same unseen breeze which also drives roundthose great mill-sails yonder with such violence, and which grinds asmuch corn in that mill, as could be ground by the efforts of a dozenhorses, kept up to their work by the whip. We have not had to move far,then, before we have come upon something which we cannot see;—before wehave proved to ourselves that we must not altogether depend upon oureye-sight for information, even concerning the existence of surroundingthings.But what is this? The breeze is not so fresh here as it was just now atthe end of the lane. There is some very disagreeable smell now floatingupon it. Here again we can see nothing, any more than we could when wehad only the fresh breeze blowing around us. But there must be somecause for the unpleasant odor. The smell gets stronger and strongeras we approach this bank. We climb over the bank, and we find on theother side, in the corner of a field, a manure-heap, from which thesmell is evidently poured out. Now that smell is really a vapor, bredof decay in the manure, and then steaming up from it into the air. Ifour eyes were as sharp as our noses, we should be able to see a hostof little bodies rushing up from the manure, and scattering themselvesthrough the air. It is because some of those little bodies strike uponthe lining of our noses, as they are drawn in by our breathing, that wesmell the unpleasant odor. The nose feels the touch of those bodies asa smell.Wherever substances which have been alive, are dead and undergoingdecay, vapors of this kind are bred and steamed forth. This is the wayin which dead things are got rid of; they turn to vapor and crumble todust. If we could see all the vapors that are being bred of decay, weshould be sensible of a thick mist covering the entire face of the landand sea, and rising up from it continually. Some of these vapors havestrong smells, like those which issue from the manure-heap; but some ofthem can not even be smelt, any more than they can be seen.But these invisible vapors, bred of decay, were not intended to bebreathed by living creatures; and indeed, can not be breathed bythem without mischief. We are able to stand near the manure-heap forsome time without taking any particular harm, because the vaporsare scattered as fast as they are formed, and are mingled in smallquantities with large quantities of pure air. We thus breathe airtainted with these vapors, rather than the vapors themselves. Butsuppose all the air were taken away, and you were left standing withnothing around you but these vapors, what do you think would happento you? You would be dead in less than three minutes, killed by theirpoisonous power. The vapors which are bred in decaying substances arepoison vapors.You would like to know why it is, as these poison vapors are poured outin such quantities from all decaying substances, that you do not seepeople dying all around from breathing them. Did I not tell you, in thecase of the poison vapors of the manure-heap, that you could breathethem because they were freely scattered into the fresh air? Now justcome a few yards this way. You observe the smell of the manure growsless and less. Here you can not any longer perceive it, although thewind is actually blowing over the manure-heap toward us. The fact is,these poison vapors can not bear the presence of pure air. Pure airis the natural _antidote_ or remedy for their poison. The instant itmingles with them it begins to destroy their hurtfulness, and in a fewmoments it has so thoroughly accomplished this good work that no singletrace of mischievous power remains.Has it ever occurred to you to ask yourself why the pleasant wind blowsover hills and fields, and through lanes and streets? You know verywell that the wind always is blowing, more or less. Go out when youwill, you find it, if you turn the right way. It is the most uncommonthing in the world for the air to be altogether still. The fresh windblows so constantly over hill and plain, because God sends it tosweep away and destroy the poison vapors that steam out from decayingsubstances. The breeze is God’s invisible antidote to the invisiblepoison. The pleasant wind blows in order that the air may be kept freshand pure.In the open air the fresh wind very soon scatters and destroys allpoison vapors. But civilized men do not dwell always in the open air.The wind sometimes makes them feel cold, so they build themselveshouses to shut out the wind. To-night, before you go to bed in yoursmall sleeping room, you will close the windows and the door; and youwill think, when you have done so, that you have shut out everythingwhich could harm you, with the cold. But what will you say to me if Ishow you that after you have closed the windows and the door, poisonvapors are bred in great quantities in the room where you are lying?and that so long as you remain in it, they keep gathering more and morestrength, and becoming more and more dangerous. Just come back with meto the cottage, and let us look at the room in which you were sleepinglast night. The beds, you believe, are not yet made. Never mind that.I often go into rooms under such circumstances, and perhaps upon thisoccasion it may be even better for the purpose I have in view, if Ifind the chamber in disorder. At any rate let us go upstairs and takeour chance.Sure enough you have been at great pains here to keep the cold fromgetting in. There is only one casement in this low small room, andthat casement has not been unbarred since yesterday. I do not needto be told this. I make the discovery myself; for you have also keptsomething from getting out, which had better have been away. I feelat once this is not the same kind of air which we were breathing justnow in the open garden. Indeed, I can not remain in the room withoutopening the window. There; I throw open the casement, and in a fewminutes the air will be as fresh here as it is outside of the house.Now what do you think it was that made the air of this room sounpleasant? It was the poison-vapor with which it was laden, and whichhad steamed out of your body mixed with your breath during the night.Poison-vapors are bred in the bodies and in the blood of all livinganimals, just as they are in manure-heaps. All the working organs ofyour frame being exhausted by use, undergo decay and are turned intovapor, and that vapor, being _bred_ of decay, is _poison-vapor_, whichmust be got rid of out of the body as quickly as it is formed. Livingbodies are worn away into vapor by working just as mill-stones are wornaway into dust by grinding. You would see them waste under work, ifit were not that they are repaired by food. You wonder, then, that asthis vapor is poisonous, living creatures do not destroy themselves bythe poison they form in their blood? Occasionally human creatures doso destroy themselves, as I shall presently show you. But the mercifulDesigner of the animal frame has furnished a means by which, in ageneral way, the poison is removed as fast as it is formed. Can you notguess what this means is?God employs the same plan for driving away poison vapors from theinside of living animal bodies, that he uses for the purification ofthe air in the open country. He causes a current of air to circulatethrough them. Notice how, while we are talking together, our chestsheave up and down. You know this is what we term breathing. Now, whenwe breathe, we first make the insides of our chests larger by drawingtheir walls and floors further asunder. Then we make them smallerby drawing their walls and floors once more nearer together. Whenthe chest is made larger, fresh air rushes in through the mouth andwind-pipe, and through the twig-like branches of this pipe, untilit fills a quantity of little round chambers which form the ends ofthose branches. The wind-pipe branches out into several millions offine twig-like tubes, and then each tube ends in a blind extremity, orchamber exactly like this.The air-chamber in the body is covered by a sort of net-work, stretchedtightly over it. That net-work is formed of blood-vessels, throughwhich the blood is constantly streaming, driven on by the action ofthe heart. This blood sucks air from the air-chambers into itself,and carries that air onward to all parts of the living frame. Butthe blood-streams in the net-work of vessels also steam out into theair-chambers poison-vapors, which are then driven out through thewindpipe and the mouth. Thus the breath which goes into the mouth is_fresh_ air; but the breath which comes out of the mouth is _foul_air. Air is spoiled, and, as it were, converted to poison, by beingbreathed; but the body is purified by the breathing, because it is itspoison-vapors that are carried away, mingled with the spoiled air.This, then, is why men breathe. Breathing is the blowing of a freshwind through the living body for the cleansing away of its impurities.The purifying part of the air which is breathed actually circulateswith the blood through all parts of the frame.Exercise quickens and exalts the cleansing powers of the breathing—andthis is why it is of such great importance to the health. When yougo and take a brisk walk in the open air, you increase the force ofthe internal breeze. The exertion makes your chest expand to a largersize, so that it can admit more fresh air, and it also causes yourblood-streams to course along more rapidly, so that a greater abundanceof the air is carried on through your frame.    [To be concluded.]       *       *       *       *       *I could never find out more than three ways to become happier (nothappy). The first, rather a high one, is this: to soar so far abovethe clouds of life that one sees the whole external world, with itswolf-dens, charnel-houses, and thunder-rods, down far beneath us,shrunk into a child’s little garden. The second is—merely to sinkdown into this little garden, and there to nestle yourself so snuglyin some little furrow, that when you look out of your warm lark-nestyou likewise can perceive no wolf-dens, charnel-houses, and poles,but only blades, every one of which, for the nest-bird, is a tree,and sun-screen, and rain-screen. The third, finally, which I regardas the hardest and cunningest, is that of alternating with the othertwo.—_Jean Paul F. Richter._THE MAMMALIA.From the French of ERNEST MENAULT.This is a class of animals which, by their organization andintelligence, approach nearest to man. The mammalia have a bonyskeleton, the center of which is the spine, to which the other organsare attached, and whence they all radiate. They possess, also, abrain, in which the hemispheres are well developed; a heart with twoventricles and two auricles; lungs for inhaling air to oxydize theblood and stimulate all the organs, the brain especially. The thoraciccavity contains the lungs and the heart, which are always separatedfrom the abdominal cavity by a complete diaphragm.In this class the organs of sense acquire great perfection, even intheir accessory parts. For instance, the greater number of each specieshave distinct eyelids, an external ear, and other peculiarities whichare not found amongst the oviparous animals. The mouth is furnishedwith fleshy lips (except the monotrematous animals[K]), and the body ishabitually protected with a specially adapted covering.All the mammalia have five senses, but in different degrees. Thus,one species, such as the chamois and wild goats, that live upon themountains, have long sight, and can see better far away than near. Onthe contrary, the heavy races which inhabit the valleys, such as thehog and rhinoceros, can see objects best when near them. Those whoseeyes are too sensitive to bear the bright light of day, only go outduring the night, like bats, or even hide themselves under the earth,as the armadillo and hedgehog. Those creatures which are the weakest,being on that account the more timid, are gifted with a keen sense ofhearing. This enables them to avoid danger. The hare, the rabbit, thejerboa, the mouse, and other rodentia, on hearing the slightest noiseprepare for flight. The more powerful or courageous races, the lion,tiger, cat, and lynx, whose sight is keen, even at night, have shortears and weak hearing, the strength of one sense generally compensatingfor the weakness of others.With the carnivora the sense of taste becomes an eager, sanguinaryappetite, while the herbivorous animals require a delicacy of taste toenable them to distinguish the nourishing plant from that which wouldpoison them. “Thus,” says Virey, “nature adapts the constitution ofeach individual to its destiny on earth.” In depriving the armadilloand pangolins of teeth, she covers them with a coat of mail or scales.In making the hedgehog and porcupine weak and defenseless, she enablesthem to raise at pleasure a forest of sharp quills, and these animalshave only to roll themselves up and become a prickly ball, which isquite impregnable. In denying to the herbivorous animals strong teethand hooked claws, nature has armed the head of the ruminants withformidable horns; finally, she gives to the timid animals, such as therodentia, either the industry to hide themselves in the earth, likethe marmot, the rabbit, and the rat; the agility to jump from treeto tree, like the squirrel; or great quickness in running, and powerto take immense leaps in fleeing from danger, as the kangaroo, whichbounds along like a grasshopper. The llama is quite defenceless, but,if attacked, it covers its enemies with a disgusting and bitter saliva.The pole-cats, and all of that species, when pursued, throw off suchexecrable odors that their most ferocious enemies are obliged to giveup the pursuit.Some animals frighten their persecutor by frightful cries, like thehowling monkey; others mislead their foes by a number of tricks andcareful precautions, and know where to obtain safe shelter and seekobscure retreats.The smallest species, besides being more numerous and multiplying moreabundantly, are also more lively in proportion to their size than thelarger animals. Before an elephant or a whale could turn round, adormouse or a mouse would have made a hundred movements, the smallnessof the limbs giving more unity and more control over the body; theshorter muscles contract more easily, and each movement is more rapidthan amongst larger creatures. The mammalia form the intermediate classby which the other animals approach to us, and by which the inferiorspecies are grouped around man. In fact, the family of the apes seemsto come very near to the human race. On the other hand, the bats,the flying squirrel of Siberia, and other like species, appear tolink the birds to the mammalia; while the armadillo and the pangolin,quadrupeds covered either with a cuirass or with scales placed one overthe other, seem related to the reptile, such as tortoises and lizards.The amphibious mammalia, such as the seal, sea-cow, and other cetacea,which _apparently_ partake of the nature of fishes, are linked to thelarge and numerous classes of aquatic animals.“Thus,” says Virey, “the mammalia form the nucleus round which aregrouped the different superior classes of the animal kingdom as beingthe most perfect type of creation, and the first link in the chain ofanimated nature next to man.” Let us compare the various other classeswith the mammalia. The bird, inhabitant of the air, has received atemperament warm and lively, delicate and sensitive; always gay, fullof fire and inconstancy, like the variable region he traverses. Thefishes again, the cold creatures of the waters, are more apathetic, andoccupy themselves chiefly with material wants; their scaly coveringseems to steel them against gentle impressions, and hinder them fromfeeling acutely, or bringing their intelligence to anything likeperfection. The quadrupeds, on the contrary, existing in a mediumstate, equally below the airy heights, as above the deep abyss ofthe waters—sharing with man the possession and sovereignty of theearth—seem to hold the middle place between two extremes. They haveneither the ardor nor petulance of the bird, the lower sensibility ofthe fish, nor the apathy of the reptile; but, living as they do on adry and firm soil, their nature has received more consistency, andtheir frame more solidity. The locomotion of the quadruped has not therapidity of flight, nor the nimbleness of swimming; but it has not thepainful slowness of the tortoise and other reptiles.All the series of these mammalia represent a long succession ofinferior structures below that of man. The monkey, considered eitherwith regard to his external form of internal organization, seems buta man degenerated. Skeleton, members, muscles, veins, nerves, brain,stomach, and principal viscera resemble ours almost entirely, not onlyin general structure, but in the ramifications of the lesser vessels.In comparison with us it appears an imperfectly formed being, althoughit is perfect as regards its own species.The same scale of graduated inferiority is observed in descending fromthe monkey to the bat; from the latter to the sloth, to the carnivora,and through all the series.The smaller the extent of the brain, especially the hemispheres,and the fewer the number of its circumvolutions, the more brutal ormore animal do we find the creature. In fact, in the monkey itself,and the quadrupeds with long snouts, which bend toward the earth,everything tends to the growth of the appetites and the developmentof the senses. They think only of satisfying their physical wants.Of all animals the quadrupeds are the most capable of understandingus; not only on account of their organization, but also because theyare the more susceptible of being domesticated. The bird has lessrelationship with us; for, whatever familiarity or intelligence maybe attributed to the parrot or tame canary, the qualities of the dog,the beaver, and the elephant always surpass those of the most cleverbirds. The more closely a well-organized animal approaches to us, themore it can comprehend us, and we can more easily aid in developing itsintelligence. This is especially the case with the mammalia.Nevertheless, the influence of man upon the domestication of theanimals is limited by their fitness for sociability. There is not asingle domesticated species which does not, naturally, live in society.Of all the solitary species, there is not a single one which has becomedomesticated; and sociability does not in the least depend on theirintelligence, for the sheep lives in companionship, while the lion,fox, and bear live solitarily. Neither does it depend on habit; forthe long continuance of the young ones with their parents does notproduce it. The bear cherishes its young ones with as much tendernessand for as long a time as the dog, and yet the bear is amongst the mostsolitary animals.Frederic Cuvier has observed three distinct conditions amongstanimals:—The solitary species, such as cats, martens, bears, andhyenas; those which live in families, such as wolves, roebucks, etc.;those which live in societies, such as beavers, elephants, monkeys,dogs, seals, etc.Cuvier has devoted himself to the study of these societies. He followsthe progress of the animal, which, born in the midst of the flock, isthere developed, and which, at each epoch of its life, learns from allwhich surrounds it to place its new existence in harmony with that ofthe old ones. The feebleness of the young animals is the cause of theirobedience to the old, which possess strength; and the habit of obeyingonce adopted by the young, is the reason why the power still remainswith the most aged, although he has become in turn the most feeble.Whenever a society is under the direction of a chief, that chief isnearly always the most aged of the troop. Mons. Flourens thinks thatthis order may, perhaps, be disturbed by violent passions. If this bethe case, the authority passes to another: and, having commenced anewby reason of strength, they preserve the same by habit. There are,therefore, amongst the mammalia, species which form real societies;and it is from these alone that man takes all domesticated animals.The horse becomes, by domestication, the companion of man; and of allanimals of his species is the most naturally so.The sheep, which we have reared, follows us, but he also follows theflock, in the midst of which he was born. According to Cuvier, he looksupon man as the leader of the flock. Man, says M. Flourens, is to theanimals only a member of their society; all his art is reduced tomaking himself acceptable to them as an associate; for, let him oncebecome their associate, he soon becomes their chief, being superiorto them in intelligence. Man does not, therefore, change the naturalstate of these animals, as Buffon says; on the contrary, he profitsby it. In other terms, having found the animals sociable, he rendersthem domesticated; and thus domestication is not a singular case, buta simple modification, a natural consequence, of animal sociability.Nearly all our domestic animals are _naturally_ sociable. The ox, goat,pig, dog, rabbit, etc., live, by nature, in society; that is, in herdsor flocks.The cat is not really a domesticated animal—it is not subdued, onlytamed; in the same way the bear, lion, and tiger even might be tamed,but not domesticated. Man’s influence will make a sociable animaldomesticated, but a solitary animal he can only tame.       *       *       *       *       *When a thought is too weak to be simply expressed, it is a proof thatit should be rejected.—_Vauvenargues._WASHINGTON IRVING.[L]By PROF. WALLACE BRUCE.The record of Washington Irving rests like a ray of sunlight upon thepages of our early history. Born in 1783, at the close of the greatstruggle for independence, his life of seventy-six years circlesa period of growth and material progress, the pages of which thiscentennial generation has just been turning. And perhaps it is notunfitting to consider at this time the life and services of oursweetest writer, the best representative of our earliest culture. Onthe other hand, I am well aware that the great mass of mankind areabsorbed in business, and like the Athenian of old continually askingfor something new; that the initials of our nation were long agocondensed into a plain monogram of dollars, and this our nineteenthcentury represented and symbolized by a large interrogation point. Wequestion the stars, the rocks and our Darwinian ancestors; and we arethoroughly occupied in looking after our own personal interest andthe prosperity of the republic; yet I may hope that this lecture willcall up some pleasure in the hearts of those who read and re-read thewritings of Washington Irving, and will help to renew your acquaintancewith the incidents of his life, and perhaps awaken the attention ofsome who are asking what to read—the one question which more than anyother decides their individual happiness and the education of therising generation. It is my purpose this afternoon to consider hiswritings, his associations and his life; and I take up his works in theorder in which they were written, as in this way we trace the naturaldevelopment of the writer and the man.“Knickerbocker,” his earliest work, written at the age of twenty-six,bears the same relation to his later work as “Pickwick,” the firstheir of Dickens’ invention, to his novels that followed; and thereis another point of similarity in the fact that “Knickerbocker” and“Pickwick” both outgrew the original design of the authors. NeitherDickens nor Irving had any idea of the character of the work hewas proposing. The philosophical and benevolent Pickwick, you willremember, was barely rescued from being the head of a holiday huntingclub; and the idea of “Knickerbocker,” at least at first, was simply toparody a small hand-book which had recently appeared under the title of“A Picture of New York.” Following this plan, a humorous descriptionof the early governors of New York was intended merely as a preface tothe customs and institutions of the city; but, like Buckle’s “Historyof Civilization,” the introduction became the body of the book, and allidea of a parody was early and happily abandoned. The “Rise and Fall ofthe Dutch Nation along the Hudson,” presented a subject of unity, andgave Irving an opportunity to depict the representative of a race whosecustoms were fast passing away. The serio-comic nature of the work isintensified by notices in the New York _Post_ calling attention tothe mysterious disappearance of Diedrich Knickerbocker. Never was anyvolume more happily introduced. Before we turn a single page we have anidea of the veritable writer. The description of Knickerbocker makeshim rise before us; we become interested in the mystery that surroundshim. In fact, the charm of the book is in the simple reality or assumedpersonality of Diedrich Knickerbocker. The portrait of Don Quixotestarting out to redress the wrongs of the world is not more clearlydrawn than that of the historian of New Amsterdam, with his silver shoebuckles and cocked hat and quaint costume. But there is this differencein the mind of the reader: in the great satire of Cervantes there isan element of sadness. We see a crazed old man wandering out in questof adventure, exciting our pity, almost excusing the paradox of LordByron: the saddest of all tales, and more sad still because it makesus laugh. Here there is only a mild sort of insanity about the oldgentleman, with his books and papers and various employments, whichtouches our humor, without exciting our sympathy. By the way, the booksof humor which we have here associated with each other belong to thesame form, are second cousins of one another, and ought to stand uponthe same shelf of our libraries.Some of the Holland families are reported to have taken the work inhigh dudgeon, as a rash innovation of the domain of history; and Ibelieve one of the gentler sex, who perhaps had no lover to fighta duel or no brother to take her part, proposed herself with herown hands to horsewhip the offensive writer for his bold attempt atspelling and printing for the first time some of the old family names.From to-day’s standpoint these things seem ludicrous and uncalledfor in reference to a work abounding in kindly humor everywhere,accepted as the finest blending of the classic and the comic in allliterature; and were it not that these early enemies soon became hiswarmest friends, I should pass it over in silence. The transitionwas so sudden and severe that it is one of the pleasantest in hishistory. In later years Irving thus refers to “Knickerbocker”: “WhenI find, after the lapse of forty years this haphazard production ofmy youth cherished among the descendants of the Dutch worthies; whenI find its very name become a household word, and used to give thehome stamp to everything recommended for popular acceptance; when Isee rising around me Knickerbocker societies, Knickerbocker insurancecompanies, omnibuses, steamboats, bread, ice, wagons; and when I findNew Yorkers of Dutch descent priding themselves upon being genuineKnickerbocker stock, I please myself with the persuasion that I havestruck the right chord, that my dealings with the good old Dutch timesand customs derived from them are right in harmony with the beliefsand humors of our townsmen, that I have opened up a vein of pleasingassociations equally characteristic and peculiar to my native place,and which its inhabitants will not willingly suffer to pass away; andthat although other histories of New York may appear of higher claim tolearned acceptance, and may take their appropriate and dignified rankin the family library, Knickerbocker’s history will still be receivedwith good-humored intelligence.” It was, indeed, wide from the soberaim of history; but no volume ever gave such rose-tinted colors to theearly annals of any country, and New York instead of being covered withridicule, is to-day the only city of this Union whose early historyis associated with the golden age of poetry, with antiquity extendingback into the regions of doubt and fable; and it is safe to say thatthe streams of Scotland are no more indebted to the genius of RobertBurns and Walter Scott than the Hudson and the Catskills to the pen ofWashington Irving. [Applause.][At this point the lecturer gave some illustrations of Irving’s style;his rendering of them being, as usual, all that could be desired.]In this his first volume we would naturally look for hischaracteristics as a writer, and we find a rich fund of humor andinvention; but here and there are gentle touches and the promise ofother qualities, to which Walter Scott refers in a letter to one of hisfriends. He says: “I have never read anything so closely resembling thestyle of Dean Swift, as the annals of Diedrich Knickerbocker. I think,too, there are some passages which indicate that the author possessespowers of a different kind, and he has some touches which remind me ofSterne.”The prophecy of Scott waited ten years for its fulfillment, but itcame at last in the most charming collection of essays in our language,the “Sketch-Book,” which I divide into essays of character andsentiment, English pictures and American legends. The “Broken Heart”is perhaps the greatest favorite of his character sketches, and at thesame time a transcript of his early experience. In the short space ofsix pages he portrays the qualities of woman’s nature, and illustratesit with the touching story of Curran’s daughter, whose heart was buriedin the coffin of Robert Emmet. This essay was suggested by a friendwho had met the heroine at a masquerade. The name and the time of itswriting were closely associated with Moore’s familiar poem:    “She is far from the land where her young hero sleeps,     She sings the wild songs of her dear native plains,       Every note which he loved awaking;     Ah! little they think, who delight in her strains,       How the heart of the minstrel is breaking.”In the whole range of English literature I know of no pen exceptIrving’s which could have written an essay like this in plain andsimple prose. We find the same tender sentiment in Burns’ “HighlandMary,” and Poe’s “Annabel Lee;” but poetry is the natural language ofpassion and sorrow. Irving has often been likened to Addison, but inthis particular they have nothing in common. Edward Everett has wellsaid: One chord in the human heart, the pathetic, for whose weirdmusic Addison had no ear, Irving touched with the hand of a master.He learned that in the school of early disappointment; and in thefollowing passages we seem to hear its sad but sweet vibration, stillresponding through years of sorrow to the memory of her whose hopeswere entwined with his: “There are some strokes of calamity, whichscathe and scorch the soul, which penetrate to the vital seat ofhappiness, and blast it never to put forth bud and blossom; and letthose tell her agony who have had the portals of the tomb suddenlyclosed between them and the being they most loved on earth, who havesat at its threshold as one shut out in the cold and lonely world,whence all that was most lovely and loving had departed.”It is said that when Lord Byron was dying at Missolonghi, he requiredan attendant to read to him the “Broken Heart,” and while the attendantwas reading one of the most tender portions the poet’s eyes moistened,and he said: “Irving never wrote that story without weeping, and I cannot hear it without tears.” He added: “I have not wept much in thisworld, for trouble never brings tears to my eyes; but I always hadtears for the ‘Broken Heart.’”Kindred to this, I select “The Wife” as a true picture of woman’spower in adversity. As the story goes, his friend Leslie had married abeautiful and accomplished girl, and having an ample fortune, it washis ambition that her life should be a fairy tale. Having embarked inspeculation, his riches took to themselves wings and flew away, leavinghim in bankruptcy. For a time he kept his situation to himself, butevery look revealed his story; and at last he told all to his wife. Wesee her rising from a state of childish dependence, and becoming thesupport and comfort of her husband in his misfortune. Following themfrom a mansion to a cottage, we feel that the last state of that man isbetter than the first; in the knowledge and possession of such a hearthe had truer riches than diamonds can symbolize. [Applause.] To thecredit of our better nature, the words of Irving are true: “There is inevery true woman’s heart a spark of heavenly fire, which lies dormantin the broad daylight of prosperity, but which kindles up and blazesin the dark hour of adversity. No man knows what the wife of his bosomis, what a ministering angel she is, until he has gone with her throughthe fiery trials of this world.” Outside the dramas of Shakspere andthe pages of Walter Scott, I know of no such pictures of gracefulwomanhood as we find in these sketches.Another quality no less marked than his humor and pathos we see in hisreverence and love for antiquity, which forms a marked feature in theEnglish pictures. In his “Rural Life” and “Christmas Sketches” we seehis love for the old English writers, and that Chaucer and Spenser werehis favorite authors. “To my mind these early poets are something morethan wells of English undefiled. They are rather like the lakes of theAdirondacks, separated from each other and from us by events which loomup like mountains in the world’s history; clear and cool in far offsolitudes, reflecting in their bright mirrors the serenity of earth andthe broad expanse of heaven, responding to the gentle glow of summersunset, holding quiet communion with the evening stars and awakeningrosy life at the first touch of morn.... The old English ballads haveall the energy, the rhythm and sparkle of our mountain streams, butChaucer and Spenser and Shakspere and Bunyan are the fountains fromwhich flows a river, ay, the Hudson of our English language.” Withthis deep love for the masters of English literature, we are notsurprised that Westminster Abbey, with its poets’ corner, should be thesubject of one of his earliest essays; and the principal feature ofthis essay, that which makes it the enduring one of all that have beenwritten upon this venerable pile, is its truth and sincerity. It is,indeed, pleasant, in these days of irreverence; when flippant writingis received for wit and mis-spelled slang accepted for originality;when popular literature is running into low levels of life and luxuryand the vices and follies of mankind; when modern poets take their cuefrom the heathen Chinee and find rhyme and rhythm in subdued oathsand significant dashes; when even home ballads are infected with thespeech, if not the morality of Jim Bludsoe; in these days of scoffingat all things temporal and spiritual; when it seems as if belief hadgone out of man: we turn with satisfaction to these essays, in whichwe see the nobility of a loyal heart, and feel that truth and goodnessand beauty, the offspring of God, are not subject to the changes whichupset the invention of man. [Applause.] I make no quotation from thisfamiliar essay; it possesses too much unity to detach a paragraph or asentence. I can only say I read it over and over again with the sameinterest to-day as years ago in the deep shade of that melancholy aisleat the tomb of Mary Queen of Scots.There is one other place in England where I took my pocket editionof the “Sketch-Book”—to Stratford-on-Avon, for, more than any otherman, Irving is associated with the world’s greatest poet. Writerswithout number, and many of them well known to fame, have given theirimpressions of Stratford-on-Avon, but Irving’s description supersedesthem all. In this companionship of Shakspere and Irving we see theenduring qualities of the human heart. In the deep sympathy of Irvingfor the olden time, we feel that he has added another charm toStratford, and that we as a nation have a better claim to the greatpoet.In Irving’s “Rip Van Winkle,” and “Legend of Sleepy Hollow,” which Itake as illustrations of his “American Legends,” we see that he isone of the few writers who recognize the fact that comedy is quite asnatural as tragedy. At the time this essay was written we understandthat Irving had never visited the Catskill Mountains; but there is thisfeature about all his essays or stories: wherever he locates them, theyseem at once to take root and flourish. This story is too well known,through the genius of Jefferson on the stage, and Rogers in the studio,to need delineation. The old Dutch village, with its philosophers andsages, the sorely-tried Gretchen, the shiftless, good-natured VanWinkle, the adventure on the mountains, the return—it all passes beforeour minds like a series of pictures; and we come to the closing scene,which the play-writer and dramatist would have done well to follow, forthere is more dramatic unity in the story which Irving left us than inthe drama.I must pass over to-night “Bracebridge Hall,” the “History ofColumbus,” the “History of Washington,” the “Alhambra,” and many more,which, as we think of them, rise up before us like a new vision of the“Arabian Nights” in our literature; and in order to read them and getthe full beauty of Irving’s works, we must read them in connection withhis “Life and Letters,” published by his nephew, Peor Irving, in whichwe see the whole history of the man pass before us, from the time whenthe boy of twenty went through the northern wilderness of New York,until the time when, a man of seventy, he again stood on the banks ofthe St. Lawrence, and in a letter to his niece called up the changes offifty years.[After referring to the changes Irving had lived to see take place, thespeaker made the following allusion to Chautauqua:]Think of Mr. Miller when he ten years ago laid out the site of thefirst humble cottage in this grove; and if he had slept from that timeuntil now, he would be more than Rip Van Winkle, could he look into-night upon this Auditorium. [Applause.]HOURS OF REST.By ANNA H. DRURY.    “Come ye yourselves apart into a desert place, and rest    awhile.”—MARK vi: 31.    Come ye apart, and rest awhile      From all your hope, from all your fear:    The sunny fields where harvests smile,      The thankless soil, the blighted ear—    Leave all behind, and rest with Me    One hour in still Gethsemane!    Come ye apart, and find repose      In this the garden of My pain;    Drink of the cup I share with those      Who lose for Me, and find it gain.    I from an angel comfort drew,    But I myself will comfort _you_!    Come ye apart, and taste the calm      My love can shed beneath the rod.    Rest on the everlasting Arm—      Be still, and know that I am God!    Accept your Heavenly Father’s Will,    As I accepted—and was still.    Come ye, as Moses came of old,      While humbled Israel mourned below,    And wrestled for his guilty fold,      With pangs that only shepherds know;    And won them back the forfeit grace!      Sealed with My glory on his face!    Come ye, as erst Elijah came,      Through forty days of mystic fast;    And through the earthquake, storm, and flame,      Thrilled to the still small voice at last;    And learned, when every hope looked dim,    That unknown thousands prayed with him!    Come, rest with Me on that stern bed      Whose tortures were endured for you;    Till faith and patience perfected,      There, where I triumphed, triumph too.    Who share the Paschal nail and thorn,    Shall know the joy of Easter morn!THE RESOURCES OF THE UNITED STATES.In a book written by J. Harris Patton, M. D., and published by D.Appleton & Co., entitled “The Natural Resources of the United States,”we find so much information that commends itself to every citizen ofthe country, that we have noted a few of the general facts, hopingthereby to give some light on the great wealth of our country. Fromthis little book we learn first the general position and descriptionof the country, together with the mountain ranges, rivers, lakes,valleys, etc.; then the amount of available coast line. This is, onboth oceans, nearly 18,000 miles, while the shore line of the lakes andnavigable rivers is 11,000 miles in length, making 29,000 miles in all.The vast importance of this need only be suggested to bring up a hostof advantages that we derive from such means of traffic. In comparingthe coal fields of Europe with those of the United States it is foundthat the latter country has twenty square miles of coal for one ofthe former, with a surplus of territory in the Rocky Mountain regionamounting to 100,000 square miles. The ease with which the coal of theUnited States is mined is of great importance in the industry of thecountry. This facility of mining is due to the thickness of the veinsand the dip of the seams.Anthracite coal is most abundant in Pennsylvania. There are overfour hundred and seventy square miles of this coal with an averagethickness of sixty feet. Anthracite is also found in Virginia, RhodeIsland, and New Mexico. Of bituminous coal there seems to be such ageneral distribution that almost every part of the country is suppliedwith fields of its own. The bituminous coal fields of the Alleghenylie on the western slope of the mountains and extend through WesternPennsylvania across the upper course of the Ohio river; and in likemanner southwest along the slope nearly to the Gulf.In many of these localities the beds of iron ore and limestone areall in the same mountain with the coal, and as they are all above thewater-level, the coal is dry and well adapted to blast furnace purposes.Block and cannel coals are found in great quantities throughout Ohioand Indiana. Block coal is also abundant in Iowa and Illinois.Lignite is found in vast fields in the Rocky Mountain district. Theveins of this partly formed coal are often nearly thirty feet thick.It is useful where great heat is not required. The extent of thesefields on the east of the Rockies, and between them and the Sierras, isestimated to be fifty thousand square miles.On the Pacific slope there are many localities where seams of coal arenow worked, some of which are over one hundred feet in thickness. Thesefields extend far up into Alaska.Iron-ore is found in inexhaustible quantities. The Creator seemsto have placed the most useful of minerals within the reach of allmankind. New York State produces ore that yields iron of the bestquality. Rich ores are found in New Jersey, while Pennsylvaniasurpasses all other states in her minerals. Ore is found in this statein all conditions, and of almost every variety. The ore is oftenassociated with limestone and coal. Virginia has some valuable depositsof iron that are practically free from sulphur and phosphorus. NorthCarolina is rich in singular beds of ore which, when mined, looks likeblack sand. This ore is the “black oxide.” Kentucky, Tennessee andAlabama all have important beds of ore. In Missouri there are two largemountains containing one-tenth of their weight in iron. Lake Superiorregions are so valuable that ore is mined in this country and shippedto Pittsburgh to be smelted. Even the Rocky Mountains are well suppliedwith iron-ore in many places.Gold and silver. These constitute the precious metals of the UnitedStates, and though the world could dispense with them, they are soughtafter and prized by all classes. The opening up of the great West isdue to these metals. They are produced in limited quantities in theAllegheny range, but the methods of working the ore in these mines arenot well enough adapted to make it paying property. The Rocky Mountainsand the Sierras contain ore bearing both gold and silver in largequantities. The gold and silver fields of the United States occupynearly one hundred and fifty thousand square miles. Of the metals iron,zinc, platinum, nickel, etc., we have limited quantities in the UnitedStates.Massachusetts has tin. Zinc is found in New Hampshire and New York,while New Jersey is the only State that has this metal in payingquantities. Nickel has been found in Connecticut and Maryland. Platinumis found in Idaho.Petroleum producing territory covers an area of two hundred thousandsquare miles, and from this vast amount it would seem that the worldcould be supplied from the United States alone for an indefinite numberof years.Lead is found in abundance in some of the Eastern and many of theWestern States. At Galena, in Illinois, there is a lead deposit thatwill supply this metal for centuries.Vast fields of copper are found in the State of Michigan and IsleRoyale, yet it is quite abundant in many of the other States of theUnion.Mercury is produced from cinnabar, an ore found in California, and isuseful in extracting gold and silver.Graphite comes from New York, Massachusetts, Vermont, Connecticut, andNorth Carolina. That of New York is especially fine, and fit for makingthe best quality of pencils.Slate, granite, sandstone and marble are found in such vast quantitiesin the Northeastern States that the supply may be deemed inexhaustible.The country contains immense beds of gypsum, clay, whetstone, slate forpencils and glass-sand.The salt industries of the Middle States are very great, the quantityseems to be without limit, and the pumping of brine for a series ofyears does not seem to weaken its strength.Fertilizers in the shape of phosphates, limestone and marl aboundeverywhere; while health-giving mineral springs are distributedthroughout the breadth of the land.The resources of the United States are not confined to minerals, butenormous wealth is in the natural fertility of the soil. Supplied withcopious rain fall over a vast territory, the soil yields throughout thedifferent latitudes such variety of products that nothing seems leftto be desired in this line. Even where the rain fall is very littlethe land will give abundant return if the farmer will only irrigatethe soil. Grains, fruits, grasses, etc., are produced in wonderfulquantities.Our forests are enormous in extent, though they have suffered fromwanton destruction, and with proper care, may be made to supply timberfor hundreds of years.The review of the fishing industries by the author gives astonishingfigures to show us how much we are indebted to the lakes and seas forour food.Fur bearing animals are abundant, as also wild game of all kinds.By carefully constructed, though liberal laws, the government has madeit possible to get homes in the great West, to obtain mining lands andin all has done the best for the working man and citizen.       *       *       *       *       *We are less annoyed when fools despise us, than when we are slightlyesteemed by men of understanding.—_Vauvenargues._MONTANA.By SHELDON JACKSON, D.D.“Her empire the cradle of the two mightiest rivers of North America;a scepter of gold in her right hand, and a shield of silver in herleft; her cornucopia full and overflowing from the abundance of her ownbosom; and with the dawning star of statehood flashing independencefrom her youthful forehead, she will soon fall into line and ‘marchto the music of the Union.’ Seated on her throne of forest-deckedmountains, her enchanting landscapes of    ‘Mountain, forest, and rock,     Of deep blue lake and mighty river,’stretching in picturesque grandeur toward either main—the Missouriher natural carrier to the east, and the Columbia to the west; thetrade, traffic, and travel of two worlds rattling over her mountainsand through her valleys by the great Northern Pacific or Northern Utahrailways; her power centered on Nature’s wall of division between thewaters of the Atlantic and Pacific, with an equal interest in thecommerce of both; valleys teeming with bountiful harvests and mines ofboundless wealth in the precious metals; with such natural attractionsand advantages, is it possible to draw an over-colored picture of herfuture?”The country of which the above is a glowing description, is, with theexception of Alaska, the youngest of our territorial dependencies.It was cut off from Idaho and formed into a Territory May 26, 1864.Stretching for 275 miles from north to south, and 460 to 540 miles fromeast to west, it embraces a territorial area of 143,776 square miles;an area equal to three States like New York, the Empire State of theEast.Its surface is beautifully diversified with mountains, valleys,foot-hills, rivers, and creeks. The mountains supply the mineralsand the timber; the foot-hills and uplands unlimited grazing for allkinds of stock; the creeks and rivers a water-power a hundred-foldgreater than all New England. It is estimated that this great inlandempire contains 10,000,000 acres of farming land, 21,000,000 acres ofmountains, 5,000,000 acres of mines, 12,000,000 acres of timber, and38,000,000 acres of grazing land.Like Minnesota, it is a great water-shed. The Yellowstone, Madison,Jefferson, Muscleshell, Milk, Big Horn, Tongue, Powder, Sun andGallatin rivers drawing their supplies from unnumbered springs andcrystal rivulets descending from numberless mountain gorges, formthe Missouri River; while the Big Blackfoot, Missoula, Hell Gate andFlathead rivers through the Columbia find their way to the Pacific. Thehills and mountains bordering these rivers are spurs putting out fromthe main range of the Rocky Mountains, and sometimes excel in heightand grandeur the main range itself.As its name signifies, Montana is a mountainous country. The westernportion is traversed by the main, the Cœur d’Alene and Bitter Rootranges. In the northern portion are the Bear Paw, and Little Rockyranges; in the central the Snow, Judith and Bull ranges; and in thesoutheast the Big Horn, Powder River and Wolf ranges. These have avarying height of from 7,000 to 11,000 feet, and by their arrangementform a series of depressions or basins, of which there are four largeones east and one west of the Rocky Mountains proper.Though far to the north the mean temperature of some of the valleys isthat of Philadelphia.Like Minnesota it is a dry, invigorating climate and remarkable for itssalubrity and freedom from malaria. On an average there are 250 days ofsunshine during the year.With the present development of the country there are about 300,000head of cattle, 60,000 horses and 300,000 sheep; the annual product ofwheat, 450,000 bushels; oats, 650,000 bushels; barley, 60,000 bushels;vegetables, 500,000 bushels, and 70,000 tons of hay. Montana is alsorich in timber, coal, and the precious metals. In the past sixteenyears more than $120,000,000 worth of gold-dust has been washed fromher placers.The first authentic information of Montana was given to the countryby the famous expedition of Lewis and Clark in 1804. In 1834 Capt.Bonneville, and in 1853 Gov. I. I. Stevens, threw additional light uponthe character of the country.The permanent settlement of the country commenced with the rush of goldminers. As early as 1852 the existence of gold was discovered, but thisknowledge was not made available until 1862, when the rush commenced,culminating in 1865-66.The first mining settlement was at Bannock. Discovered in the summer of1862 by some miners from Colorado, that winter found clustered therea population of 2,000; desperados from Idaho, bankrupt speculatorsfrom Nevada, guerrilla refugees from Missouri, miners from Colorado,gamblers and saloon-keepers, with a small leaven of good and true men.It was to that point that the Presbyterian Committee of Home Missionssent their first missionary.The following year gold was discovered in Alder Gulch, and Bannock wasdeserted for the new diggings. With the population went Rev. Messrs.Smith and Price, Presbyterian ministers, and the first Protestantclergymen to preach in the Territory.In 1864 Rev. A. M. Hough, the first regularly appointed Methodistmissionary, reached the new diggings and commenced preaching.Virginia City, the outgrowth of the Alder Gulch mines, is the countyseat of Madison County. Like all mining towns, it was not laid out, butgrew. The miner only wanted a temporary shelter, and every newcomerlocated his log cabin to suit himself, usually adjoining the last onebuilt. When common convenience required a street, a street appeared.There were no yards or gardens, for beyond the narrow ravine filledwith straggling cabins, only grew sage-brush. The miners thrived andthe city grew. For sleeping accommodations a limited space was allottedupon the floor, the occupant furnishing his own blankets; and it wasa long time before the regular diet of bacon, bread, and dried appleswas varied by a potato. But gradually things changed; a better class ofbuildings appeared; the number of gambling and tippling places steadilydecreased; the vigilantes gained the upper hand of the roughs; oldresidents brought in their wives and children, and the whole face ofthings became more like the “States.”From the huge piles of dirt and stone that mar the beauty of the gulch,has been taken out $30,000,000 worth of gold dust. Of the ten thousandmen that once worried and toiled and fought for gold, only about onethousand remain; yet the city is improving, and has a good future instore.The next discovery of rich mines was on the Prickly Pear Creek. TheFisk Brothers with a colony from Minnesota had crossed the plains tothis point and worked on quietly until the fame of the “Last ChanceMines” went abroad throughout the land, and a city arose like anexhalation, taking the name of Helena from the resemblance of thesurrounding hills to those in the isle of St. Helena. Helena is notonly the political capital, but the commercial, literary, social andreligious center of the territory. It has many handsome buildings andis growing rapidly.In the meantime discoveries were made in many directions and smallcamps of miners flourished until their gravel beds were worked over, ora new excitement enticed away the miners. The latest developed and mostflourishing of the mining centers is at Butte, which has become thelargest city in the Territory.Among the beautiful villages with a promising future may be mentionedDeer Lodge, situated in a beautiful grazing valley. The first whitesettler was Johnny Grant, who had among his wives a squaw from everytribe that roamed that section. When the Flatheads passed by his ranch,no woman was to be seen but a Flathead, and when the Blackfeet came thesole wife of his bosom was a Blackfoot. And thus he lived at peace withthe natives, a sharer in their spoils and an arbiter in their quarrels.Down the Hell Gate River to the northwest of Deer Lodge is thebroad, rich valley of the Bitter Root, with Missoula as its thrivingcounty-seat. For many years the great Hudson Bay Fur Company had astation in that valley and monopolized the fur trade. From thencewestward the natives speak the famous Chinook jargon, invented by thecompany to facilitate trade with the natives. Words were borrowed fromthe English, French, and various Indian tongues and worked into anincongruous combination which the all powerful influence of the companyintroduced everywhere. The Flathead and Pend d’Oreilles Indians thatnow inhabit that region are under papal influence. Among them is theJesuit mission of St. Ignatius.To the northeast of Helena is Fort Benton, which was originally builtin 1846 as a trading post of the American Fur Company, and afterwardssold to the Northwestern Fur Company. Situated at the head of steamnavigation on the Missouri River, it is growing rapidly and promises tobe an important place. From thence, in days past, the citizens of theTerritory would take a steamer for Sioux City, Iowa, two thousand milesdistant by the windings of the river—a thousand miles of which was thenthrough a wild Indian country. Steamers were frequently fired into byhostile Indians, whose camps and graves were met at frequent intervals.This route also passed through wild, and among the Citadel Rocks, weirdscenery. These curious rocks are of soft white sandstone, worn into athousand grotesque shapes by the waters which have come down from thetable-lands during the unknown ages of the past.To the southeast of Helena is Bozeman, a picturesque village with grandnatural surroundings and a grand future as a city on the main lineof the Northern Pacific Railway. From it the eye can range over fourhundred miles, and a little way to the south of it, over the range,is the great Yellowstone Park—the enchanted wonderland—where trappersdeclare “they have seen trees, game and even Indians petrified, and yetlooking as natural as life; where they have seen a mountain of quartzso transparent that they could see the mules feeding on the otherside;”—a combination of many of the freaks of nature, which are usuallylooked for and found over many and widely separated lands. Already anincreasing throng of tourists each summer are visiting its falls andcañons, its geysers and springs.To the eastward down the Yellowstone Valley is Miles City, named afterGeneral Miles of the United States Army.The rising cities of Glendive, Billings and Miles are examples of thegreat transformation that is passing over Montana with the advent ofrailways.Only six years ago the savage Indians destroyed Custer and his troopsof the 7th United States Cavalry, and held full sway of the entirevalley of the Yellowstone. Now railway trains pass up and down throughits scores of villages and hundreds of farms.The census of 1880 gives the following statistics: Population 39,157;Roman Catholics, 10 churches and 13 priests; Disciples of Christ,6 churches and 4 ministers; Methodist Episcopal, 8 churches and 6ministers; Methodist Episcopal (South), 9 ministers; ProtestantEpiscopal, 8 churches and 6 ministers; Presbyterian, 6 churches and 7ministers.There are in the territory 19,791 Indians, of whose children only 287are in school. Among the American population are 5,885 children ofschool age, of whom 2,804 are in school.TALES FROM SHAKSPERE.By CHARLES LAMB.MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING.There lived in the palace at Messina two ladies, whose names wereHero and Beatrice. Hero was the daughter, and Beatrice the niece, ofLeonato, the governor of Messina. Beatrice was of a lively temper, andloved to divert her cousin Hero, who was of a more serious disposition,with her sprightly sallies. Whatever was going forward was sure to makematter of mirth for the light-hearted Beatrice.At the time the history of these ladies commences, some young men ofhigh rank in the army, as they were passing through Messina on theirreturn from a war that was just ended, in which they had distinguishedthemselves by their great bravery, came to visit Leonato. Among thesewere Don Pedro, the prince of Arragon, and his friend Claudio, who wasa lord of Florence; and with them came the wild and witty Benedick, andhe was a lord of Padua.These strangers had been at Messina before, and the hospitable governorintroduced them to his daughter and his niece as their old friendsand acquaintance. Benedick, the moment he entered the room, began alively conversation with Leonato and the prince. Beatrice, who likednot to be left out of any discourse, interrupted Benedick with saying,“I wonder that you will still be talking, Signor Benedick; nobodymarks you.” Benedick was just such another rattlebrain as Beatrice,yet he was not pleased at this free salutation; he thought it did notbecome a well-bred lady to be so flippant with her tongue; and heremembered, when he was last at Messina, that Beatrice used to selecthim to make her merry jests upon. And as there is no one who so littlelikes to be made a jest of as those who are apt to take the sameliberty themselves, so it was with Benedick and Beatrice; these twosharp wits never met in former times but a perfect war of raillery waskept up between them, and they always parted mutually displeased witheach other. Therefore when Beatrice stopped him in the middle of hisdiscourse with telling him nobody marked what he was saying, Benedick,affecting not to have observed before that she was present, said,“What, my dear lady Disdain, are you yet living?” And now war broke outafresh between them, and a long jangling argument ensued, during whichBeatrice, although she knew he had so well approved his valor in thelate war, said she would eat all he had killed there: and observing theprince take delight in Benedick’s conversation, she called him “theprince’s jester.” This sarcasm sank deeper into the mind of Benedickthan all Beatrice had said before. The hint she gave him that he was acoward, by saying she would eat all he had killed, he did not regard,knowing himself to be a brave man; but there is nothing that great witsso much dread as the imputation of buffoonery, because the charge comessometimes a little too near the truth; therefore Benedick perfectlyhated Beatrice, when she called him “the prince’s jester.”The modest lady Hero was silent before the noble guests; and whileClaudio was attentively observing the improvement which time hadmade in her beauty, and was contemplating the exquisite graces ofher fine figure (for she was an admirable young lady), the princewas highly amused with listening to the humorous dialogue betweenBenedick and Beatrice; and he said in a whisper to Leonato, “This is apleasant-spirited young lady. She were an excellent wife for Benedick.”Leonato replied to this suggestion, “O my lord, my lord, if they werebut a week married, they would talk themselves mad.” But though Leonatothought they would make a discordant pair, the prince did not give upthe idea of watching these two keen wits together.When the prince returned with Claudio from the palace, he found thatthe marriage he had devised between Benedick and Beatrice was not theonly one projected in that good company, for Claudio spoke in suchterms of Hero, as made the prince guess at what was passing in hisheart; and he liked it well, and he said to Claudio, “Do you affectHero?” To this question Claudio replied, “Oh, my lord, when I waslast at Messina, I looked upon her with a soldier’s eye, that liked,but had no leisure for loving; but now, in this happy time of peace,thoughts of war have left their places vacant in my mind, and in theirroom come thronging soft and delicate thoughts, all prompting me howfair young Hero is, reminding me that I liked her before I went to thewars.” Claudio’s confession of his love for Hero so wrought upon theprince that he lost no time in soliciting the consent of Leonato toaccept of Claudio for a son-in-law. Leonato agreed to this proposal,and the prince found no great difficulty in persuading the gentle Heroherself to listen to the suit of the noble Claudio, who was a lord ofrare endowments and highly accomplished; and Claudio, assisted by hiskind prince, soon prevailed upon Leonato to fix an early day for thecelebration of his marriage with Hero.Claudio was to wait but a few days before he was to be married tohis fair lady; yet he complained of the interval being tedious, asindeed most young men are impatient, when they are waiting for theaccomplishment of any event they have set their hearts upon. Theprince, therefore, to make the time short to him, proposed as a kindof merry pastime, that they should invent some artful scheme to makeBenedick and Beatrice fall in love with each other. Claudio enteredwith great satisfaction into this whim of the prince, and Leonatopromised them his assistance, and even Hero said she would do anymodest office to help her cousin to a good husband.The device the prince invented was, that the gentlemen should makeBenedick believe that Beatrice was in love with him, and that Heroshould make Beatrice believe that Benedick was in love with her. Theprince, Leonato, and Claudio began their operations first, and watchingan opportunity when Benedick was quietly seated reading in an arbor,the prince and his assistants took their station among the trees behindthe arbor, so near that Benedick could not choose but hear all theysaid; and after some careless talk the prince said, “Come hither,Leonato. What was it you told me the other day—that your niece Beatricewas in love with Signor Benedick? I did never think that lady wouldhave loved any man.” “No, nor I neither, my lord,” answered Leonato.“It is most wonderful that she should so doat on Benedick, whom shein all outward behavior seemed ever to dislike.” Claudio confirmedall this, with saying that Hero had told him Beatrice was so in lovewith Benedick, that she would certainly die of grief, if he could notbe brought to love her; which Leonato and Claudio seemed to agreewas impossible, he having always been such a railer against all fairladies, and in particular against Beatrice.The prince affected to hearken to all this with great compassion forBeatrice, and said, “It were good that Benedick were told of this.” “Towhat end?” said Claudio; “he would but make sport of it, and torturethe poor lady worse.” “And if he should,” said the prince, “it were agood deed to hang him; for Beatrice is an excellent sweet lady, andexceeding wise in everything but in loving Benedick.” Then the princemotioned to his companions that they should walk on, and leave Benedickto meditate upon what he had overheard.Benedick had been listening with great eagerness to this conversation;and he said to himself, when he heard Beatrice loved him, “Is itpossible? Sits the wind in that corner?” And when they were gone, hebegan to reason in this manner with himself: “This can be no trick!they were very serious, and they have the truth from Hero, and seemto pity the lady. Love me! Why, it must be requited. I did never thinkto marry. But when I said I should die a bachelor, I did not think Ishould live to be married. They say the lady is virtuous and fair. Soshe is. And wise in everything but in loving me. Why, that is no greatargument of her folly. But here comes Beatrice. By this day, she is afair lady! I do spy some marks of love in her.” Beatrice now approachedhim, and said with her usual tartness, “Against my will, I am sent tobid you come in to dinner.” Benedick, who never felt himself disposedto speak so politely to her before, replied, “Fair Beatrice, I thankyou for your pains;” and when Beatrice, after two or three more rudespeeches, left him, Benedick thought he observed a concealed meaning ofkindness under the uncivil words she uttered, and he said aloud, “If Ido not take pity on her, I am a villain; if I do not love her, I am aJew. I will go get her picture.”The gentleman being thus caught in the net they had spread for him,it was now Hero’s turn to play her part with Beatrice; and for thispurpose she sent for Ursula and Margaret, two gentlewomen who attendedupon her, and she said to Margaret, “Good Margaret, run to the parlor;there you will find my cousin Beatrice talking with the prince andClaudio. Whisper in her ear, that I and Ursula are walking in theorchard, and that our discourse is all of her. Bid her steal into thatpleasant arbor, where honeysuckles, ripened by the sun, like ungratefulminions, forbid the sun to enter.” This arbor, into which Hero desiredMargaret to entice Beatrice, was the very same pleasant arbor whereBenedick had so lately been an attentive listener. “I will make hercome, I warrant, presently,” said Margaret.Hero, then taking Ursula with her into the orchard, said to her, “Now,Ursula, when Beatrice comes, we will walk up and down this alley, andour talk must be only of Benedick, and when I name him, let it beyour part to praise him more than ever man did merit. My talk to youmust be how Benedick is in love with Beatrice. Now begin; for lookwhere Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs close by the ground, to hear ourconference.” They then began; Hero saying, as if in answer to somethingwhich Ursula had said, “No truly, Ursula. She is too disdainful; herspirits are as coy as wild birds of the rock.” “But are you sure,” saidUrsula, “that Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?” Hero replied, “Sosays the prince, and my lord Claudio, and they entreated me to acquainther with it; but I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick, never to letBeatrice know of it.” “Certainly,” replied Ursula, “it were not goodshe knew his love, lest she made sport of it.” “Why, to say truth,”said Hero, “I never yet saw a man, how wise soever, or noble, youngor rarely featured, but she would dispraise him.” “Sure, sure, suchcarping is not commendable,” said Ursula. “No,” replied Hero, “but whodare tell her so? If I should speak she would mock me into air.” “Oyou wrong your cousin,” said Ursula: “she can not be so much withouttrue judgment, as to refuse so rare a gentleman as Signor Benedick.”“He hath an excellent good name,” said Hero: “indeed he is the firstman in Italy, always excepting my dear Claudio.” And now, Hero givingher attendant a hint that it was time to change the discourse, Ursulasaid, “And when are you to be married, madam?” Hero then told her, thatshe was to be married to Claudio the next day, and desired she wouldgo in with her, and look at some new attire, as she wished to consultwith her on what she should wear on the morrow. Beatrice, who had beenlistening with breathless eagerness to this dialogue, when they wentaway, exclaimed, “What fire is in my ears? Can this be true? Farewellcontempt, and scorn and maiden pride, adieu! Benedick, love on! I willrequite you, taming my wild heart to your loving hand.” It must havebeen a pleasant sight to see these old enemies converted into new andloving friends; and to behold their first meeting after being cheatedinto mutual liking by the merry artifice of the good-humored prince.But a sad reverse in the fortunes of Hero must now be thought of. Themorrow which was to have been her wedding-day, brought sorrow in theheart of Hero, and her good father Leonato.The prince had a half-brother, who came from the wars along with himto Messina. This brother (his name was Don John) was a melancholy,discontented man, whose spirits seemed to labour in the contrivingof villanies. He hated the prince his brother, and he hated Claudio,because he was the prince’s friend, and determined to prevent Claudio’smarriage with Hero, only for the malicious pleasure of making Claudioand the prince unhappy; for he knew the prince had set his heart uponthis marriage, almost as much as Claudio himself: and to effect thiswicked purpose, he employed one Borachio, a man as bad as himself, whomhe encouraged with the offer of a great reward. This Borachio paidhis court to Margaret, Hero’s attendant; and Don John, knowing this,prevailed upon him to make Margaret promise to talk with him from herlady’s chamber window that night, after Hero was asleep, and also todress herself in Hero’s clothes, the better to deceive Claudio into thebelief that it was Hero; for that was the end he meant to compass bythis wicked plot.Don John then went to the prince and Claudio, and told them that Herowas an imprudent lady, and that she talked with men from her chamberwindow at midnight. Now this was the evening before the wedding, and heoffered to take them that night, where they should themselves hear Herodiscoursing with a man from her window; and they consented to go alongwith him, and Claudio said, “If I see anything to-night why I shouldnot marry her, to-morrow in the congregation, where I intended to wedher, there I will shame her.” The prince also said, “And as I assistedyou to obtain her, I will join with you to disgrace her.”When Don John brought them near Hero’s chamber that night, they sawBorachio standing under the window, and they saw Margaret looking outof Hero’s window, and heard her talking with Borachio; and Margaretbeing dressed in the same clothes they had seen Hero wear, the princeand Claudio believed it was the lady Hero herself. Nothing could equalthe anger of Claudio, when he had made (as he thought) this discovery.All his love for the innocent Hero was at once converted into hatred,and he resolved to expose her in the church, as he had said he would,the next day; and the prince agreed to this, thinking no punishmentcould be too severe for the naughty lady, who talked with a man fromher window the very night before she was going to be married to thenoble Claudio.The next day, when they were all met to celebrate the marriage,and Claudio and Hero were standing before the priest, and thepriest or friar, as he was called, was proceeding to pronounce themarriage-ceremony, Claudio, in the most passionate language, proclaimedthe guilt of the blameless Hero, who, amazed at the strange words heuttered, said meekly, “Is my lord well, that he does speak so wide?”Leonato, in the utmost horror, said to the prince, “My lord, why speaknot you?” “What should I speak?” said the prince: “I stand dishonored,that have gone about to link my dear friend with an unworthy woman.Leonato! upon my honor, myself, my brother, and this grieved Claudio,did see and hear her last night at midnight talk with a man at herchamber-window.” Benedick, in astonishment at what he heard, said,“This looks not like a nuptial.”“True, O God!” replied the heart-struck Hero; and then this haplesslady sank down in a fainting fit, to all appearance dead. The princeand Claudio left the church, without staying to see if Hero wouldrecover, or at all regarding the distress into which they had thrownLeonato, so hard-hearted had anger made them. Benedick remained, andassisted Beatrice to recover Hero from her swoon, saying, “How does thelady?” “Dead, I think,” replied Beatrice in great agony, for she lovedher cousin; and, knowing her virtuous principles, she believed nothingof what she had heard spoken against her. Not so the poor old father;he believed the story of his child’s shame, and it was piteous to hearhim lamenting over her, as she lay like one dead before him, wishingshe might never more open her eyes.But the ancient friar was a wise man, and full of observation on humannature, and he had attentively marked the lady’s countenance when sheheard herself accused, and noted a thousand blushing shames to startinto her face, and then he saw an angel-like whiteness bear away thoseblushes, and in her eye he saw a fire that did belie the error that theprince did speak against her maiden truth, and he said to the sorrowingfather, “Call me a fool; trust not my reading, nor my observation;trust not my age, my reverence, nor my calling, if this sweet lady lienot guiltless here under some biting error.”When Hero recovered from the swoon into which she had fallen, thefriar said to her, “Lady, what man is he you are accused of?” Heroreplied, “They know that do accuse me; I know of none.” Then turning toLeonato, she said, “O my father, if you can prove that any man has everconversed with me at hours unmeet, or that I yesternight changed wordswith any creature, refuse me, hate me, torture me to death.” “Thereis,” said the friar, “some strange misunderstanding in the prince andClaudio;” and then he counseled Leonato, that he should report thatHero was dead; and he said that the death-like swoon in which theyhad left Hero would make this easy of belief; and he also advised himthat he should put on mourning, and erect a monument for her, and doall rites that appertain to a burial. “What shall become of this?”said Leonato; “What will this do?” The friar replied, “This report ofher death shall change slander into pity; that is some good, but thatis not all the good I hope for. When Claudio shall hear she died uponhearing his words, the idea of her life shall sweetly creep into hisimagination. Then shall he mourn, if ever love had interest in hisheart, and wish he had not so accused her; yea, though he thought hisaccusation true.” Benedick now said, “Leonato, let the friar adviseyou; and though you know well I love the prince and Claudio, yet, on myhonor, I will not reveal this secret to them.”Leonato, thus persuaded, yielded; and he said sorrowfully, “I am sogrieved, that the smallest twine may lead me.” The kind friar then ledLeonato and Hero away to comfort and console them, and Beatrice andBenedick remained alone; and this was the meeting from which theirfriends, who had contrived the merry plot against them, expected somuch diversion; these friends who were now overwhelmed with affliction,and from whose minds all thought of merriment seemed forever banished.Benedick was the first who spoke, and he said, “Lady Beatrice, haveyou wept all this while?” “Yes, and I will weep a while longer,” saidBeatrice. “Surely,” said Benedick, “I do believe your fair cousin iswronged.” “Ah!” said Beatrice, “how much might that man deserve of mewho would right her!” Benedick then said, “Is there any way to showsuch friendship? I do love nothing in the world so well as you; is notthat strange?” “It were as possible,” said Beatrice, “for me to sayI loved nothing in the world so well as you; but believe me not, andyet I lie not. I confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry formy cousin.” “By my sword,” said Benedick, “you love me, and I protestI love you. Come, bid me do anything for you.” “Kill Claudio,” saidBeatrice. “Ha! not for the wide world,” said Benedick; for he lovedhis friend Claudio, and he believed he had been imposed upon. “Is notClaudio a villain, that has slandered, scorned, and dishonored mycousin?” said Beatrice; “O that I were a man!” “Hear me, Beatrice!”said Benedick. But Beatrice would hear nothing in Claudio’s defense;and she continued to urge on Benedick to revenge her cousin’s wrongs;and she said, “Talk with a man out of the window; a proper saying!Sweet Hero! she is wronged; she is slandered; she is undone. O that Iwere a man for Claudio’s sake; or that I had any friend who would be aman for my sake; but valor is melted into courtesies and compliments.I can not be a man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman withgrieving.” “Tarry, good Beatrice,” said Benedick; “by this hand I loveyou.” “Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it,” saidBeatrice. “Think you on your soul that Claudio has wronged Hero?” askedBenedick. “Yea,” answered Beatrice, “as sure as I have a thought, or asoul.” “Enough,” said Benedick, “I am engaged; I will challenge him.I will kiss your hand, and so leave you. By this hand, Claudio shallrender me a dear account. As you hear from me, so think of me. Go,comfort your cousin.”While Beatrice was thus powerfully pleading with Benedick, and workinghis gallant temper by the spirit of her angry words, to engage in thecause of Hero, and fight even with his dear friend Claudio, Leonatowas challenging the prince and Claudio to answer with their swords theinjury they had done his child, who, he affirmed, had died for grief.But they respected his age and his sorrow, and they said, “Nay, do notquarrel with us, good old man.” And now came Benedick, and he alsochallenged Claudio to answer with his sword the injury he had done toHero; and Claudio and the prince said to each other, “Beatrice hasset him on to do this.” Claudio nevertheless must have accepted thischallenge of Benedick, had not the justice of Heaven at the momentbrought to pass a better proof of the innocence of Hero than theuncertain fortune of a duel.While the prince and Claudio were yet talking of the challenge ofBenedick, a magistrate brought Borachio as a prisoner before theprince. Borachio had been overheard talking with one of his companionsof the mischief he had been employed by Don John to do. Borachio madea full confession to the prince in Claudio’s hearing, that it wasMargaret dressed in her lady’s clothes that he had talked with from thewindow, whom they had mistaken for the lady Hero herself; and no doubtcontinued on the minds of Claudio and the prince of the innocence ofHero. If a suspicion remained it must have been removed by the flightof Don John, who finding his villanies were detected, fled from Messinato avoid the just anger of his brother.The heart of Claudio was sorely grieved, when he found he had falselyaccused Hero, who, he thought, had died upon hearing his cruel words;and the memory of his beloved Hero’s image came over him, in the raresemblance that he loved it first; and the prince asking him if whathe heard did not run like iron through his soul, he answered, thathe felt as if he had taken poison while Borachio was speaking. Andthe repentant Claudio implored forgiveness of the old man Leonatofor the injury he had done his child; and promised, that whateverpenance Leonato would lay upon him for his fault in believing thefalse accusation against his betrothed wife, for her dear sake hewould endure it. The penance Leonato enjoined him was, to marry thenext morning a cousin of Hero’s, who, he said, was now his heir, andin person very like Hero. Claudio, regarding the solemn promise he hadmade to Leonato, said he would marry this unknown lady, even though shewas an Ethiop: but his heart was very sorrowful, and he passed thatnight in tears, and in remorseful grief, at the tomb which Leonato haderected for Hero.When the morning came, the prince accompanied Claudio to the church,where the good friar, and Leonato and his niece, were alreadyassembled, to celebrate a second nuptial; and Leonato presented toClaudio his promised bride; and she wore a mask, that Claudio might notdiscover her face. And Claudio said to the lady in the mask, “Give meyour hand, before this holy friar; I am your husband, if you will marryme.” “And when I lived, I was your other wife,” said this unknown lady;and taking off her mask, she proved to be no niece (as was pretended),but Leonato’s very daughter, the lady Hero herself. We may be sure thatthis proved a most agreeable surprise to Claudio, who thought her dead,so that he could scarcely for joy believe his eyes: and the prince,who was equally amazed at what he saw, exclaimed, “Is not this Hero,Hero that was dead?” Leonato replied, “She died, my lord, but while herslander lived.” The friar promised them an explanation of this seemingmiracle, after the ceremony was ended; and was proceeding to marry themwhen he was interrupted by Benedick, who desired to be married at thesame time to Beatrice. Beatrice making some demur to this match, andBenedick challenging her with her love for him, which he had learnedfrom Hero, a pleasant explanation took place; and they found they hadbeen both tricked into a belief of love, which had never existed,and had become lovers in truth by the power of a false jest: but theaffection, which a merry invention had cheated them into, was growntoo powerful to be shaken by a serious explanation; and since Benedickproposed to marry, he was resolved to think nothing to the purposethat the world could say against it; and he merrily kept up the jest,and swore to Beatrice, that he took her but for pity, and because heheard she was dying of love for him; and Beatrice protested, that sheyielded but upon great persuasion, and partly to save his life, for sheheard he was in a consumption. So these two mad wits were reconciled,and made a match of it, after Claudio and Hero were married; and tocomplete the history, Don John, the contriver of the villany, was takenin his flight, and brought back to Messina; and a brave punishment itwas to this gloomy, discontented man, to see the joy and feastingswhich, by the disappointment of his plots, took place at the palace inMessina.THE HEAD AND THE HEART.By JOHN G. SAXE.    The head is stately, calm and wise,      And bears a princely part;    And down below in secret lies      The warm, impulsive heart.    The lordly head that sits above,      The heart that beats below,    Their several office plainly prove,      Their true relation show.    The head erect, serene, and cool,      Endowed with Reason’s art,    Was set aloft to guide and rule      The throbbing, wayward heart.    And from the head, as from the higher,      Comes every glorious thought;    And in the heart’s transforming fire      All noble deeds are wrought.    Yet each is best when both unite      To make the man complete;    What were the heat without the light?      The light, without the heat?DEFECTS IN OUR AMERICAN HOMES.[M]DR. VINCENT: The subject for conference this evening at this houris “Defects in Our American Homes.” This is not a lecture; it is aconversation. You are to give your thoughts, I am to record them, andwe shall then discuss them.Every organization has a spirit in it, and out of the spirit comeinfluence and action. Out of wrong ideas come mistakes. Out ofimpotency—where one has an ideal, and not moral force enough to carryit out—comes failure. In the Syrian homes there are defects that belongto their civilization, their doctrines, their modes of life, theirlimitations. In Italian homes there are defects; so in German and inEnglish homes. The defects of the Italian home differ from those of theEnglish. There are defects in our American homes. What are they? Thereare defects which characterize us as well as other nations, in thisnineteenth century; and defects which are the products or the resultsof our peculiar doctrines of society and of government. As we go aboutin our neighborhoods; as we travel to and fro in the land, read thepapers and listen to lectures and sermons on the subject, we findpeculiar evils that exist to-day in American families. It is to look atthe dark side of the American home that we are met to-night. I want youto think and I want you to speak. If any of you has a thought to give,and don’t like to speak it out, write it and I shall be glad to read itfor the instruction of all. We take the American home, and I ask youfor a list of the defects which belong to the average American home.First—What?[The various defects mentioned by different speakers are given withoutthe names of the speakers; the comments usually are by Dr. Vincent.]Selfishness.REV. B. ADAMS: I should group the defects of the homes, as I know them,in the region where I live, under the following letters: I, irreligion;second I, indulgence; third I, ignorance; P, pride; C, covetousness;four L’s, laziness, lying, levity and lust.DR. VINCENT: Where do you live? [Laughter.]MR. ADAMS: In the State of Connecticut, where there is one divorce inevery nine marriages. I propose to try to reform my part of it.Want of parental control.The separation of the young from the old, and the separation of thesexes in the family.DR. VINCENT: What do you mean?I mean that the young people try to get off by themselves, when theywould better mix with the older people; and the result is a tendency todisintegration of the elements of the family.Want of helpfulness.Failure to provide proper literature for the home.Lack of true parental example.Failure to supply proper amusements.Irreverence among young people for older persons.Too much unnecessary labor; working for fashion, etc. Ladies spend toomuch time dressing, and men spend too much time in smoking: too muchtobacco in the family. [Laughter.]Too much responsibility in the matter of education devolved upon thewife.The fallacy that the son is influenced more by the mother than by thefather.Men spend too much time away from home.Too much time is spent at home by mothers.They ought to come to Chautauqua. [Laughter.]Worldly conversation too abundant and prominent at home.Too much indifference to the family altar.Children are allowed to visit the theater, when parents should hold upsomething better for them.Enough attention is not paid to the associations of the children.Want of care in the formation of the habits of the children.Gossip in the family.Want of promptness on all sides: in getting up, in coming to meals, ingoing to bed, and in attending to duty generally.Unfair dependence of the wife and mother upon the husband and father inregard to money matters at home. [Laughter.]DR. VINCENT: I could talk on that subject. I have no doubt that theremight be stories told here founded on fact, relative to the consummateand ineffable meanness of some men, who dole out a pittance to theirwives, pocketing and otherwise managing to control their funds, leavingthe woman, who does the most of the work and bears the heaviest burden,to feel like a beggar most of the time. [Applause.] And the contemptwith which that man should be regarded I have no words, in the Englishor any other language, to describe. [Amen.]The growing habit of beer drinking in the family, and hard cider, too.The evil habit of criticising sermons, preachers and other Christianpeople before children, and thus making sceptics and infidels of them.Dressing children for pleasure and not for health.The mother saying to the disobedient boy, “I will tell your father ofyou:” transfer of authority from father to mother, and _vice versa_.Repression of natural child-life in the home.Want of the manifestation of affection which ought to be manifested inthe home. Husbands and wives don’t kiss each other as often as theyought to.Too much fun made of old maids; making girls marry through fear ofbecoming unlovely and unlovable old maids.Want of politeness in the family.The husband, when he carves for the family, carving out the top piecesfor the wife and family, and keeping the tenderloin for himself.[Laughter.]Want of attention to the laws of health.Assuming the inferiority of the woman’s intellect.Failure to train the children to sit with the parents in church.Late hours.Want of early consecration of the children to God.Allowing children to run at large in the street, and to select theirown playmates.Encouraging forwardness in young children.Trusting children to Roman Catholic servants, and sending our girls tonunneries and those institutions that are organized for the purposeof propagandism and proselytism. [Applause.] Americans can not be toocareful in this respect.Failure to properly regard the Sabbath in the home.Sending children to Sabbath-school, instead of taking them.Allowing children to go to three or four Sabbath-schools.The use of slang in the home.Too little familiarity in the conversation between parents and childrenon religious matters.Lack of artistic attractions in the home.What are people going to do, who cannot afford to buy costly oilpaintings, and fill up their houses with splendid furniture, etc.?Keep clean; have chromos, flowers, engravings, smiles, clay modeling,whitewash.Good bread. There is no subject on which America needs more light thanon that of good bread and good coffee. [Laughter.]Upholding the children as against the public school teacher.DR. VINCENT: We are in a regular fault-finding mood to-night. Keep atit; it is wholesome.Mother or father allowing the child to speak disrespectfully of theother parent, without reproof.Too much frying-pan. [Amen, and laughter.]Want of harmony between the father and mother in the government of thechildren; so that the child appeals from the decision of the one to theother.Preventing young children from attending temperance meetings on theLord’s day.DR. VINCENT: Well, there are certain types of temperance meetingthat I would not allow my child to attend on the Lord’s day. Sometemperance meetings are conducted in so irreverent a way that I wouldnot blame parents who are careful where they send their children onthe Lord’s day, if they do prevent them from attending such meetings.Nevertheless, it is a great mistake not to commit our children to totalabstinence.Not knowing where the children are after dark.Not knowing the needs of the children, and the neglect to provide forthem in the matter of literature, taste, associations, and all that.Parents deceiving their children. They begin this very early; sometimestelling the children horrible stories about horrible things, if thechild goes “out of that door;” and the child finds that his mother tolda downright lie, though she punished him the other day for telling alie.Not enough real work for the children, in which the whole family cantake an interest.Children sitting up too late nights.Children allowed to go away from home at too early an age, withoutpermission from parents.Young girls graduating from school and college, and spending their timein reading novels.Parents loading the plates of their children with a variety of dishes,and then doctoring them for some trouble of the stomach.Laughing at children’s big stories, thus teaching them to be untruthfulas they grow older. We should not punish a child for having told a bigstory of something he saw, without the most careful examination of thecase. The child lives in the domain of the imagination; and many a timea child has been flogged and cruelly treated for telling a thing whilehe honestly believed that which he told was true.Fretting. There is an immense amount of misery caused in the householdby fretting; and children brought up in a fretting atmosphere grow upto make other people miserable by fretting themselves.Failure to train the daughters in the art of cookery. [Applause.]Infidelity on the subject of children’s conversion. This is partlybecause of some soft, silly and irrational processes which aresometimes resorted to for what is called “Getting the childrenconverted.” [That is true.]The idea of usefulness in the world is not sufficiently appreciated. Infamilies there is too much selfishness in “living for ourselves,” forour furniture, our table, our comforts and our society; and not enoughthinking about how we may live as a center of influence for the good ofothers.Too little restriction in the matter of association between boys andgirls at that period of life when they are called the “after boy” andthe “after girl.” When they are neither boys nor girls, neither men norwomen. We put away dolls too early from the arms of our girls as theygrow up.Saying “don’t” forty times a day.Giving sympathy to the girls, and neglecting the boys in the home.There should be not less sympathy to the girls, but more sympathy tothe boys.DR. VINCENT: Taking for granted that boys ought always to be rough,and girls always to be gentle—and so girls should, and boys too; butat the same time there is a roughness which is fitting to a boy thatyou can not endure in a girl. I love to see a boy grow up, full ofmanhood, and yet never ashamed to kiss his mother or his father whenthey meet. I take great pride in any boy, who growing up to be a man,gives expression as a man to that tender feeling of love with which heregards mother and father.Parents forget that the little child’s troubles are just as seriousthings to it, as the greater troubles of grown people are to them. Thelittle waves of the bay are as hard on the little boats as the bigwaves of the sea are on the big ships; and many a child at four or fiveyears of age—younger or older—suffers acutely from sorrows that come,in which it finds no sympathy. We should remember this; and blessedis the minister and blessed is the teacher who has it in his heart tosympathize with and comfort the little people in their sorrows.The foolish emphasis placed by parents upon the intellectualattainments of their children, while the moral qualities are regardedas of no consequence. It is frightful to contemplate the standardswhich prevail in our public schools and generally in our educationalinstitutions of to-day, by which memory is taxed, and knowledge ofscience, knowledge of literature and of mathematics emphasized, andscarcely any attention whatever paid to the moral foundations. We cannot regard this with too great solicitude, nor labor as parents toocarefully for governing the development of the moral element.Father and mother should read to and with their children, while thechildren are small. Then they will be likely to form habits of readingin later years.Homes lack well-considered purpose and systematic effort. People planfor their business; they plan for their summer tours; they plan inevery line, except that of the home training, the home spirit, and thehome life.Too little frankness and too little genuine simplicity encouraged amongyoung girls. It is a bad thing if, through shame or fear of beinglaughed at, a girl fails to tell the sweetest and deepest and richestthings of her heart’s life to her own mother. Blessed is the home wherethe girl is trained never to keep anything from her mother, and wherethe boy is trained always to confide in father. Boys and girls who arebrought up with that confidence never go to ruin.Illiteracy in the home:—Resulting from so many people not joining theC. L. S. C.DR. VINCENT: I honestly believe that the C. L. S. C. will fulfill auseful ministry in this respect in American homes. I have had somebeautiful letters to that effect: one from a lady the other day, out ofwhich I shall read on commencement day, relates to the service of theCircle in increasing the sympathy between the husband and wife in linesof reading and study. I never talk about home, but I have pleasantmemories of one of the best homes that mortal ever enjoyed; a fatherwho lived for his children, and a mother who set a constant exampleof the faith and sweetness and patience of the true woman and mother.May God grant his blessing upon the thoughts that have swept throughour minds to-night, and make our homes all the better because of thisconference.       *       *       *       *       *We had better appear what we are, than affect to appear what we arenot.—_La Rochefoucauld._C.

C.The Memorial Day for April is Shakspere’s Day, Monday, April 23.       *       *       *       *       *All local circles, especially new ones, should report to Miss K. F.Kimball, Plainfield, N. J.       *       *       *       *       *Why would it not be well for members to order at once volume two ofTimayenis’s Greek History for next summer? If this is done early, thepublishers will know how many copies to print. There will, therefore,be less delay next season.       *       *       *       *       *When a member of the C. L. S. C. gives his name and postoffice addressto Miss Kimball, or to the Superintendent of Instruction, let himremember that no postoffice address is complete without the name of theState. The members would be surprised to learn how many omit the State.       *       *       *       *       *Prof. Timayenis says that Athene was called the “Stern-Eyed” because,among her other attributes, she was also the goddess of war. “As shewent along the ranks of the armor-clad Greeks, her eye shone like fireflashing in sternness.”       *       *       *       *       *A member of the C. L. S. C. writes: “I beg to inform you that I can nottake up that geology at all, as it is something that does not at allinterest me, and I can not possibly make time on it, as I do not seemto profit by it.” To meet this very class of people we require but avery small amount of reading in geology. The book by Prof. Packard is avery short one, may be read in the course of two or three hours, and Ishall be compelled to require the reading of it in order to cover theground contemplated by our course.       *       *       *       *       *In the February number of THE CHAUTAUQUAN, the address of Henry Hart,manufacturer of the C. L. S. C. badge, was given as Lockport, insteadof Brockport, N. Y., as it should be.       *       *       *       *       *A correspondent writes: “Then, according to Mr. Worman, ‘Goethe’ ispronounced ‘Gearte.’ Is it?” We sent the above question to Prof.Worman and asked him whether or not the _r_ sound enters into thepronunciation of Goethe. Prof. Worman replies: “Of course the _r_ isnot sounded, but allowed to affect the sound of _ea_, so that we do sayGöé-thê. Webster, last edition, page 1684 (explanation of abbreviationof signs) says: ‘ö has a sound similar to _e_ in her.’ Compare page1682 (14). Of course the _r_ is not sounded. Compare Worman’s CompleteGerman Grammar, page 16.”       *       *       *       *       *A correspondent makes inquiry concerning Prof. Packard’s statementon page 52 of his “First Lessons in Geology:” “During the process ofupheaval, as soon as the great plateau appears above the ocean, rainstorms produce rills and brooks, the ocean leaves Mediterranean seasand land-locked lakes, whose waters gradually evaporate, their saltsbecoming fresh.”Our correspondent says: “Our philosophies distinctly teach that bodiesof water grow salt rather than fresh by evaporation, as only pure wateris evaporated, while all salts and impurities remain. Will you be sokind as to explain the discrepancy. I read it with all care, and cannot reconcile it with previous study and reading.”To this criticism Prof. Packard makes reply: “Whatever be the factstated in chemical works, the fact I stated is true, that land-lockedbodies of the ocean become fresh,—more or less. This is owing,probably, to the supply of fresh water by rivers. If the Baltic Seashould be land-locked, it would make an inland lake. The great SaltLake was formerly a fresh water lake,—shrinking in size, and losingits outlet into Snake River it became salt. Lake Superior was once anarm of the sea. So Lake Titicaca, in Peru. So with some of the Swedishlakes. Perhaps my statement that they evaporate their salts is inexact,but the original salt water dries up, and what is left is greatlydiluted,—whatever be the process,—the geological facts above stated aretrue.”       *       *       *       *       *“May I read books instead of THE CHAUTAUQUAN?” Better read THECHAUTAUQUAN. You thus get a wide range of reading; a knowledge of thework of the C. L. S. C.; sympathy with its leaders and members; manypractical courses for reading and study. It will be difficult to be anadvanced and intense member of the C. L. S. C. without THE CHAUTAUQUAN.       *       *       *       *       *What shall I say when people ask, “What are the benefits of belongingto the C. L. S. C.? Why not take the same studies in the local circle,without such membership?” Answer: Persons who belong to the localcircles and avail themselves of the benefits of the suggestions, thecourses of study, etc., which come from the central Circle, do sowithout making any contribution whatever toward the C. L. S. C. as ageneral movement in society. They get what costs them nothing. Peoplewho belong to the general Circle have the satisfaction of knowingthat they are, by their annual fee of fifty cents, helping on a greatmovement that reaches over the whole world; and while no one of theofficers of the C. L. S. C. makes any money out of the work, except themeager salary paid to our secretary, a great deal of time is given,a great deal of printing done, a great deal of postage paid, a greatdeal of advertising circulated, for the sake of acquainting the publicwith this educational movement. Members of local circles who do notbelong to the general Circle know that they are making no contributionwhatever to the general work, while they are, without paying a penny,reaping the benefits of it. To this, however, we do not object. We arealways glad to have members of local circles. Those who belong to theregular C. L. S. C. have the benefits of the communications which comefrom the central office, the memoranda, the systematic ways of work,identification with a great fraternity like a college, the privilegeof membership in the several societies within the circle, such as “TheHall in the Grove,” “The League of the Round-Table,” etc., etc. Theyalso receive diplomas, and additional incentives to add seals to themduring the years. There are many benefits accruing to those who belongto the C. L. S. C.       *       *       *       *       *Who is the son of Capaneus, mentioned by Wilkinson (Prep. Greek inEnglish), page 165?

I have donehousework for some time at seventy-five cents per week, buying my ownclothes; so I said to myself I will save enough of my wages to purchasethe books in the C. L. S. C. course, and I have succeeded. I haveenjoyed the study of geology, though I could not afford to have themaps and charts. A map of Ancient Greece was sent me by Dr. Vincent. Ihope to soon begin a course in literature and music in an academy.C. L. S. C. TESTIMONY.How can such deeply-imprinted images sleep in us at times, till a word,a sound, awakes them?—_Lessing._       *       *       *       *       *_Ohio._—Much of my reading has been done in the sickroom. I wish Icould tell you how thoroughly I have enjoyed my reading so far. I knowI have acquired a much more eager desire for “solid reading” than Iever had before.       *       *       *       *       *_Indiana._—My own illness, and other afflictions in my home, havedelayed my work for ’82, but I hope my paper is not too late to beaccepted for last year’s work. I have commenced the C. L. S. C.work with the intention of completing it some time, in spite of allhinderances.       *       *       *       *       *_Maine._—I have noticed several times your school mentioned indifferent papers, and have thought I might, perhaps, be able to takethe course. My time is pretty well taken up, but I have a boy, nineyears of age, who takes _The Wide Awake_, and is interested in thearticles contained in the supplement, and I think I might be betterable to answer his questions if I were reading what would help me to doso. I have quite a good selection of books, but perhaps can obtain whatyou use.       *       *       *       *       *_Connecticut._—I can not tell you how well I like the C. L. S. C.course. It is just what I want, and what I need. There is no way Icould so well fill up the vacant moments as to read from some of thebooks of the Chautauqua course. It contains so much good solid reading.I am _determined_ to keep on, doing the best I can, and think I canabout catch up before commencing on the next year’s study.       *       *       *       *       *_Pennsylvania._—I believe that I have made some improvement by mystudies, for I have not read so much for six years. I have made but afeeble effort in answering questions, but I hope to do better in thefuture. I really had not the time to read the special course. Next yearI hope to have help for myself from some new books. I am truly thankfulfor the privilege of membership in the C. L. S. C., and I hope I cancatch up with the class in 1885.       *       *       *       *       *_Massachusetts._—I have pursued the C. L. S. C. course entirely alone,and at times I have felt a little discouraged, but never have wanted togive it up, and now that I have graduated I want to keep right on, buthardly know which of the special courses to take up. I will continue tohave THE CHAUTAUQUAN because I enjoy it very much. I can not express toyou how much good this course has done me, although I can not repeatmuch of it yet. The world and life seem very different to me now fromwhat they did four years ago.       *       *       *       *       *_Vermont._—I want to tell you how much I thank you for the C. L. S. C.course. I was obliged to leave school before I graduated, on accountof my father’s death, to take care of my mother, who is an invalid.The Chautauqua course was just what I wanted, and it has cheered manylonely hours. I have studied alone this year but am hoping that someof my friends will take the course next year. I think it is a grand andnoble work and just fitted to meet the wants of a large class of peoplewho are denied the privilege of a course of study at school.       *       *       *       *       *C. L. S. C. SONG.JOIN, O FRIENDS, IN A MEMORY SONG.    MARY A. LATHBURY.      (ALUMNI SONG.)      WM. F. SHERWIN, 1877.[Illustration: Music]    1 Join, O friends, in a mem’ry song,      A song of service, of faith, of praise;    Of love that gathers its fiber strong      From forest soil and Chautauquan days.    CHORUS.    Sing, O sing! for the Word shall spring    From seed to scion, from bud to bloom,    Since life immortal the Lord did bring    From the Seed that fell in an open tomb!    2 Join in a hymn of hope, O friends,      The Lord is coming his own to bless,    And tried and true is the band he sends      To open a way in the wilderness.    _Chorus._    3 After the brier, the thorn, the weed,      Shall spring a plant of a wondrous birth;    And Love—the flow’r of a heavenly seed—      With bloom and beauty shall fill the earth.    _Chorus._Copyright, 1877, by J. H. Vincent.       *       *       *       *       *_Wisconsin._—While at the Monona Lake Assembly, at Madison, Wisconsin,I was induced through Rev. A. H. Gillet to enter the C. L. S. C. for1883. I have commenced and followed the readings so far with muchinterest. Owing to increasing business complications as clerk ofcircuit court, added to my law studies, I am not certain that I shallbe able to keep up with the readings near enough to pass creditably.I shall endeavor, however, to go through with the course in the timerequired. I am the only C. L. S. C. student I know of in this part ofthe State (southern). I would be glad to know of others, and would beglad if I could establish a circle in Monroe, where I shall be afterJanuary 1, 1883. The Chautauqua course fills a long felt want amongthose who have never had the advantage of a collegiate education, aswell as among overworked professional men, who have only a limitedtime in which to keep up a course of reading in science or literature.I shall endeavor in all possible ways to extend the knowledge of thebenefits of this course. I have heard some objections to the Circlefrom those who held aloof, owing to the fact that it was conductedwholly by a religious denomination. In fact, I held this idea atfirst, and a further one, that the course was one wholly religious. Iam convinced to the contrary, and shall convince others. I should beglad to hear by letter from some others who are engaged in this coursealone. We might be a mutual help to one another.LOCAL CIRCLES.    [We request the president or secretary of every local    circle to send us reports of your work, or ask the    circle to elect a member to write up your method    of conducting the circle, together with reports of    lectures, concerts, entertainments, etc.—Editor THE    CHAUTAUQUAN, Meadville, Pa.]=Vermont (Bennington).=—Our circle is doing much better work thisyear than it did last year. Some of the members did not complete thereadings last year, but they are going on with this year’s course.       *       *       *       *       *=Massachusetts (Brocton).=—We have twenty-five members, sixteen of whomare regular members of the C. L. S. C. We meet monthly and our methodof work thus far has been the preparation and reading of essays on thesubjects of the required reading, followed by discussions. The most ofus are enthusiastic Chautauquans and we look for large results from ourwinter’s work. Although there have been members of the C. L. S. C. heresince its organization in 1878, this is the first effort that has everbeen made to form a local circle.       *       *       *       *       *=Massachusetts (Hopkinton).=—We have a circle of thirty members who dowhatever is assigned to them, and a committee of five who arrange forthe meetings which occur in two weeks.       *       *       *       *       *=Massachusetts (Walpole).=—Our circle numbers nineteen members. Mr. S.E. Baily, principal of the High School is president. The meetings areheld every alternate week at the secretary’s house. At each meeting thepresident drills us on our work for the past fortnight.       *       *       *       *       *=New York (Albany).=—Our Albany circle was organized in 1880, with amembership of five. Since then we have been steadily growing, and ourlist of regular members now numbers fifty. During the first year we metat the homes of the members, but since then we have met in the Assemblyroom of the old Capitol. We vary in the method of conducting ourmeetings, which are held monthly. Two or three subjects are generallyassigned, and essays are prepared and read, followed by a generaldiscussion. Then, again, the evening will be devoted to one subject.Century arches and our question-box are interesting features. We havehad several fine lectures from our own and neighboring clergymenand scientific men. Dr. Vincent gave a new impetus to the work by alecture, delivered in one of our churches a year ago.       *       *       *       *       *=New York (Spencerport).=—The first meeting of the Spencerport circlefor the year 1882-3, was held September 12. The meeting was moreespecially for the purpose of showing to the public the aim of theC. L. S. C., the work which had been accomplished by the Spencerportcircle during the past year, and the work which was laid out for themto do during the coming year; and as the public were invited to attendthe meeting, the purpose was not in vain. There were nearly one hundredpresent, exclusive of the members of the circle, and the program wasexcellent and entertaining; a very pleasant feature of which was adescription of the Chautauqua Assembly, and graduating exercises ofthe Class of ’82, by Mrs. James Hickcok, she being a member of thatclass. Subsequently another meeting was held, at which the officersfor the ensuing year were elected, and arrangements made for the workof the year. Quite a number of new members have been admitted, and thenumber has increased from a membership of nine regular and nine localmembers of last year, to sixteen regular and sixteen local members forthis year. The meetings are held every alternate Saturday afternoon,at three o’clock. The program consists of essays on the lives andworks of various authors, and reading selections from their writings,taking one author at each meeting; after which the questions in THECHAUTAUQUAN are asked and answered, with the privilege of discussingpoints in the subjects treated. The authors already treated upon havebeen Tennyson, O. W. Holmes, Irving, and Bryant. At the first regularmeeting after the election of officers, the ex-president of the circle,Mrs. H. H. Hartwell, was presented with a very fine cabinet photographalbum, by the members of the circle, as a token of their esteem, andthe well wishes of the entire circle go with her to her new home inAlbion, Michigan. The meetings are very well attended, and the interestis increasing.       *       *       *       *       *=Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh).=—The following remarks were made inresponse to a toast, “The Chautauqua Idea the unchained Prometheus,”proposed at the banquet of the C. L. S. C. alumni of Pittsburgh, Pa.,January 25, by Dr. J. J. Covert: “It is written in ancient story thatone ambitious Prometheus once ridiculed the gods, and deceived evenJupiter himself. As a punishment to himself and the rest of mankind,Jupiter took fire away from the earth. But the stealthy and ambitiousPrometheus, by the aid of the beautiful Minerva (you see no great thingcould be done without woman), climbed the heavens and stole fire fromthe chariot of the sun, which he brought down to earth again. Thisso enraged the Olympian god that he ordered Prometheus chained to aCaucasian rock for thirty thousand years, while every day a vulturewas to come and dine upon his liver. The mighty Hercules slew thehateful vulture, rent the granite rock, broke the galling chains thatbound his limbs, and the unchained hero rises from his granite bed ofages, the pride of all the earth and the envy of the gods. Prometheuschained was ignorance and superstition enthroned; with limbs unfetteredhe is literature and knowledge sown broadcast in all the land. Howfitting a figure then, the language of the toast, ‘The ChautauquaIdea the unchained Prometheus.’ The selfish gods of fortune doomedthe Promethean masses to cruel and hopeless bonds of ignorance andilliteracy forever. From age to age the hateful vulture of fate fedupon the imperishable and irrepressible liver of aspiration, untilthe mighty hero Vincent Hercules arose, and heard the crying want,and armed with giant weapons forged by the Vulcan Miller, smote thegranite rock, severed the galling chains, slew the greedy vulture,and set the prisoner free, opening wide the golden gates that guardthe perennial groves and Pierian springs of Academia, where ambitiousthousands have entered—are entering still; giving to renewed thoughtthe wings of the morning, freighted with literature, art and science,that it may ‘circle’ the earth with the gilded, jeweled, mystic C.L. S. C. opportunities. See that beautiful, shadowy, Academian groveyonder, nestling in the fond embracing arms of that silvery lake! Whata fitting home and dwelling place for our unchained hero, and all themuses of the ages! Chapels, temples, palaces, amphitheaters, obelisks,and pyramids spring up as by Herculean power. Here Phidias, and Homer,and Plato, and Demosthenes, and Xenophon, and Raphael, and Angelo,have their dwelling-place. Surely this is where our unchained heroand his attendant muses dwell, and hither his disciples love to maketheir pilgrimage. Look out upon the shimmering lake in the brightnessof the early dewy morn, and listen to the music of the rippling wavesas they break upon the pebbly shore, surpassing far the mystic notesof Memnon’s shaft at early dawn of day. But now ’tis night, and starsare looking down and sparkling like jewels on the bosom of the placidlake. Sloops, and yachts, and steamers large, and smaller craft ofevery name and form, fly swiftly round with colors high and blazinglights; music of bands and ringing bells commingle with ten thousandhappy voices in the glad acclaim, and highest heaven hears the song.And now I know that this is where Prometheus dwells, whence all themuses come to celebrate the breaking of his chains, and the setting ofhim free; and whence again they fly abroad through all the land, themessage-bearers of the beautiful and true. It is the apocalyptic angelflying through the midst of heaven with the everlasting truth thatshall fill the world with light and joy. I see the mystic band withrobes of light and arms of love, from every walk of life, while joy andpeace sit undisturbed upon their brows. Oh, what a mighty host! Theyare forty thousand strong. A mystic circle binds them round, and everylink within the golden chain is set with pearls. O, for some mystictongue of fire, that I might the better speak the glories of our chosenmuse! The world-renowned ‘Chautauqua’ may not sparkle o’er our headsas a constellation in the skies, but if true Chautauquans we proveourselves to be, we shall far outshine the stars in the kingdom of hislove forever and forevermore.”       *       *       *       *       *=Pennsylvania (Sunbury).=—The circle has been in existence sinceOctober, 1880, and at present has a membership of twenty, all ladies.Our method of conducting meetings this year is very simple. We meetonce a week, on Saturday afternoons. Questions on the lesson assignedare previously written out by the president and numbered. They are thendistributed among the members and answered as they are called off.There is a great deal of free and easy discussion of the topic on hand.       *       *       *       *       *=Pennsylvania (Philadelphia).=—West Philadelphia has a thriving localcircle of fifteen ladies. We are officered with a president andsecretary, and meet weekly at the homes of the members. A teacheris appointed for each subject under consideration; for instance,next week we have a teacher to hear the astronomy, and another tohear the Russian history. These teachers are very thorough in theirquestionings; we are obliged to study our lessons well, or be mortifiedby a failure. Last year, while studying chemistry, we had a lecture(with experiments) by Prof. English. This year we gave a Christmasentertainment and invited our friends. The exercises consisted of alittle drama, readings, music and an essay on Chautauqua, read by oneof our members who visited Chautauqua last summer. At every meeting,in addition to the regular work, we have quotations from differentauthors, or else readings of an amusing as well as instructivecharacter, and often we close our meetings with what we call Chautauquagames. Thus we combine solid work with entertainment and mirth, andconsider ourselves hard-working enthusiastic Chautauquans.       *       *       *       *       *=District of Columbia (Georgetown).=—The first circle of the ChautauquaLiterary Society in this city was organized in the fall of 1880, byeight colored young ladies who are employed as teachers in the publicschools. This circle now numbers more than thirty members. The meetingsof this circle are held on Saturday evenings at the residence of eachmember alternately. The Chautauqua Literary Course is becoming quitepopular among the colored people throughout the country, and especiallyin this city. A circle has been organized at the Nineteenth StreetBaptist Church.       *       *       *       *       *=Louisiana (New Orleans).=—We, the “Longfellow” circle, are stillalive, though probably we are about the only circle in the country thathas progressed backward in point of numbers. A year ago we had sixteenmembers, now we have only half that number, owing to departures fromthe city. Those who remain are still faithful and true. We understandthat there are several other parties in New Orleans who are pursuingthe course outside of any local circle. We meet every Thursday eveningat the residence of Mr. D. L. Mitchel. The meetings are generallywell attended and very enjoyable. We have essays on various subjectsconnected with the reading, and take the questions and answers aspublished in THE CHAUTAUQUAN, with a general conversation on thereading for the week. Milton’s day was celebrated in an appropriatemanner, there being a good essay on the life and works of Milton bythe secretary, with selected readings from his writings by othermembers of the circle. Byron’s memorial day (an innovation of ourown) we celebrated with appropriate exercises on the 25th of January.The president read a splendid essay entitled, “Byron, the Man and thePoet.” Selections from the writings of Byron were also read.       *       *       *       *       *=Ohio (Wooster).=—Our class meets bi-monthly; the lesson assigned ata previous meeting is recited topically and catechetically, underthe direction of an instructor selected from the class at a previousmeeting. The assignment of the lesson is made with a view to acceptingthe suggestions and appointments of the subject as formulated in THECHAUTAUQUAN. We have had no lectures, concerts, or public socialentertainments, but we observe now and then memorial days. Our membersare very much interested in the Chautauqua Idea. Kind fellowshipdistinguishes all our meetings. We have twenty-three members, of whomtwo are graduates of 1882, three are enrolled in the class of 1883,and eighteen are pursuing the course as local members, each of whom wethink will ultimately enter the lists and capture the prize of a fullcourse.       *       *       *       *       *=Ohio (Norwalk).=—October 21, Prof. Sherwin, of Chautauqua fame, spentan hour in conversation with the circle. Up to date, no one has beenon the program more than once, and the list is little more than halfexhausted; Dr. Vincent would say “divide the class,” but this has itsobjections in the choice of leaders, and he is personally responsiblefor inventing a circle that will not break, and which needs only thatthe leaders say “write,” and they write. Among other things we havethe universal favor of the press. Among our members we have one judgeand five other lawyers, one doctor, the mayor and three insuranceagents, and so feel reasonably provided against the worst that maycome. It would be unsatisfactory to us to close this report withoutsending our compliments and congratulations to the authors whose workswe have read. Timayenis’s History has character and originality, andis read with interest. If there is in store for us a romance, let itbe another volume of “Preparatory Greek Course,” never in any caseomitting the Wilkinson. While he is a most companionable writer hispages are everywhere abundant in practical common sense. There is butone expression from this and other circles that we meet, and that is,that we have found a most pleasing author and an interesting book.       *       *       *       *       *=Ohio (Van Wert).=—The local circle of Van Wert, Ohio, was organizedin September last and soon included fifty members, which we think verycreditable for a town of four thousand people. It was started throughthe influence of a “reading circle” that was organized on the firstof April, including about seventy members, which has continued withunabated interest, not receiving any check, as some anticipated, fromthe work of the Chautauqua course. The reading circle is maintainedby one of our pastors, who found there was a large number of educatedyoung people in the community who evidently needed active mentalemployment, after their course of study in high school, college anduniversity. They were invited to meet on a certain evening at a privateresidence to consider the subject of forming a reading circle. Aprogram of exercises had been arranged consisting of select readingsand music, the selections not to occupy more than about ten minuteseach. The names of all persons present who desired to take partin these exercises were then enrolled and arranged in order by themanager, who appoints six or seven readers at each meeting. Somethingmore was desired, that would demand some continuous study. The C. L.S. C. was chosen. We meet every other week, at private residences,which we believe necessary to preserve that profitable informalitywhich would be lost in a public hall or church. The president asks suchquestions as his judgment indicates to be most profitable, the objectbeing to make the meetings as much as possible of a conversationalcharacter. We spent one evening exhibiting and studying the geologicalplates. We also obtained a small cabinet of geological specimens. Assome of our members were unable to obtain the “Greek History” and“Geology” in October we expect to resume those studies in the spring.       *       *       *       *       *=Indiana (Rushville).=—This circle numbers fifteen regular members.Three are reading in private, and six are local members of the C. L. S.C. We use the question system in conducting our semi-monthly meetings.Three memorial days have been celebrated during the current year, withappropriate exercises.       *       *       *       *       *=Indiana (La Fayette).=—The “Vincent” local circle, consisting of fiftymembers, has entered upon its second year. We have a committee onprogram, who arrange the work one month in advance; also a committeeon music. We meet the first and third Monday evenings of each month.The meeting is opened with Scripture reading and prayer. The minutesof the previous meeting are read, after which the program is followedout, consisting usually of a number of short essays on the subjectswe are studying, interspersed with excellent music. Our meetings arewell attended, and considerable enthusiasm is exhibited on the part ofmost of our members. Bryant’s and Milton’s Days have been appropriatelyobserved, and we have arranged for the observance of Longfellow’s Day.       *       *       *       *       *=Illinois (Arcola).=—This is the first year of the local circle inArcola. It is composed of four married ladies—mothers—all graduates ofthe “Bryant Class” of ’82. Notwithstanding our limited number we arevery devoted and enthusiastic. We have a president and secretary andmeet every Friday afternoon. We take our turns in acting as teacher.After the questions in THE CHAUTAUQUAN are disposed of, each member isexpected to ask not less than two questions on difficult or importantpoints in some portion of our readings, then we review and discuss,informally, all the exercises of the day. We have decided to make“Greek History” a specialty. After we organized we secured a “localhabitation” and adopted for a name “The Periclesian Class” in honor ofour favorite Greek hero. We are all highly pleased with the C. L. S. C.and we intend as a class and as individuals to use every effort to helpmake it a still greater success.       *       *       *       *       *=Illinois (Peoria).=—The circle in this place was organized the latterpart of December, 1882, and now numbers fifty-seven regular and sevenlocal members, with accessions at every meeting. We have an averageattendance of about fifty-two. The meetings are held in the parlor ofthe Young Men’s Christian Association. The committee on program sendseach member of the class a day or two before each meeting a postalcard containing a written question on the required reading, whichthe recipient is expected to be prepared to answer in a few wordsnot occupying more than a minute or two. The social intermission isgenerally occupied in discussing the books read by members of the C. L.S. C. The rest of the evening’s exercises is under the control of thecommittee on program, and is varied from evening to evening. We had atthe last meeting, and will have at the next, what we call a sentimentroll. The roll of the circle is called and each person, as his or hername is called, responds with a short sentiment selected to suit thetaste of the person selecting. This seems as if it would prove a veryinteresting exercise. Commencing, as we did, late in the season, wepostponed our “Geology” until the pleasant weather of next summer.Our committee have secured the services of one of the best geologistsin the State for instructing us in that study. He expects to begin bytaking as many of the circle as can go with him to visit mines andquarries in the neighborhood and select specimens. We will then, underhis guidance, study first the specimens and the places where they werefound, and then the books and charts. We find the sending out of thepostal cards with questions a good plan. It notifies the members of themeeting, and makes them feel that something in particular is expectedof them. It is the effort of the committee to divide the labor asevenly as possible among all the members of the circle, and the postalcard questions being sent, one to each member, compels each to saysomething during the evening and enables the most backward to do so bybeing prepared. The cards not being sent out until the day before themeeting, the required reading is all done before the card is received,so that every article is read with the thought that the question maybe on that particular subject. By each one being prepared in this wayto speak as concisely as possible, a great deal can be said in a shorttime, and the evening’s exercises close promptly at the time appointed,notwithstanding the large attendance. The members of the circle seemto be very much pleased indeed with the C. L. S. C. In our list ofmembers we have preachers, 4; lawyers, 3; merchants, 3; insurance,3; stenographers, 2; clerks, 5; druggists, 1; grain commission, 2;printers, 1; physicians, 1; general secretary Y. M. C. A. etc., ofmen, 29; ladies, 15; of Presbyterians, 12; Congregationalists, 16;Christians, 1; Reformed Episcopal, 1; Methodists, 3; Baptists, 3; notprofessing religion, 8.       *       *       *       *       *=Michigan (Quincy).=—The local circle in Quincy ushered in its secondyear with a “boom.” We feel as though we had jumped from babyhoodinto long dresses. Our ten enthusiastic members of last year havebeen reinforced by twenty more—among the best talent of the town—ofdifferent denominations. While our circle of last year was composedonly of ladies, this year we are fortified by three gentlemen. Thelesson is announced each week by the president appointing teachers forthe different branches and those to prepare essays, etc. The ministerand his wife are faithful workers, teaching history, Grecian andRussian; taking the text-book and going through the lesson thoroughlyby topic; treating the philosophy of history; applying it to our time,Government and people; discussing questions with the class and havingthem recite in concert important points. Another leads in “Geology.” Atthe last meeting we were highly entertained and profited by the reviewof Packard; each chapter was given to different members, who were“strictly forbidden to bring in any hard names.” All were surprisedand delighted to find how much beauty and desirable information eachessay contained without them. We are having a series of valuable paperson “Art and Architecture,” by our able president, beginning with theearliest records and continuing through the golden period of Greecedown to the present time. Also interesting papers on the “History ofLiterature,” by Miss Paton, preceptress of the High School, giving avivid picture of the beginning and progress of thought, introducing tous characters and their works whose influence has been stamped on eachsuccessive age—lights that never go out. We have a series of lessons onmineralogy, with blackboard chart, prepared by Miss Paton. Specimensof rocks, brought in by members, add to the interest. A critic isappointed to correct the pronunciation of words. We have added a newfeature—which meets the cordial approval of all croakers who say“What’s the use of so much ado over the ancients?”—a paper on currentevents of the week, not omitting wit and humor. Truly the mentalhorizon of each member is being widened, and slowly yet surely there isa revolution in the kind of reading matter used by the people of thistown. The public librarian said to one of our members, “We attribute tothe C. L. S. C. the silent influence at work, resulting in better booksbeing called for so often and novels less frequently than formerly.”God speed the Chautauqua Idea!       *       *       *       *       *=Michigan (Muskegon).=—I thought while reading the “Round-Table” inTHE CHAUTAUQUAN for February, that our circle must be such an one aswould meet Dr. Vincent’s ideas of what one ought to be. I am sure wedo not care for what each other may think, or, rather, we do not stopto think about that. We just speak right out, “grammar or no grammar.”There are at present six members in our circle, all married ladies withhome cares, our ages ranging from twenty-five to forty-five. Three ofus expect to receive diplomas this year. Two of the others started withus, but were unable to keep up. We are making a specialty of Englishhistory, and at each meeting the three members of the graduating classare expected to bring in short papers on that subject. We each takethe reign of a certain king or queen and write something of theircharacters, and also note the most remarkable events connected withtheir reigns. Muskegon has another circle, composed of five ladies,which was organized last fall. Every month we join with them inreviewing the month’s work. Some member is appointed from one or theother circle to act as teacher and prepare questions for the review.Our meetings are very informal. We have no rules or regulations, lawsor by-laws. Each one is a law unto herself.       *       *       *       *       *=Wisconsin (Sheboygan).=—We have twelve regular and ten local members.We hold our meetings every Monday evening, and find them bothentertaining and profitable. Each member is requested to bring not lessthan three and not more than six questions upon the week’s reading,questions either for information or for examination. These questionsare then put into a hat and each member draws his question; of coursethere is more or less discussion upon most of the questions and once ina while the president finds it necessary to call the meeting to order.In addition we are sometimes entertained by essays upon differentsubjects. One evening one of the ladies gave a delightful paper on “TheDomestic Life of the Greeks;” another paper was upon “Coal;” and stillanother upon “Scandinavian Mythology.” Occasionally we have singing andrecitations, making the evenings so helpful and enjoyable that all lookforward to them with much pleasure.       *       *       *       *       *=Wisconsin (Berlin).=—Our society was organized in 1872, and named“Friends in Council, No. 3.” We are one of nine societies now bearingthat name. In 1879, by a vote of the members, we adopted the C. L. S.C. course of study, fifteen of our number becoming regular members.We have received an addition of eight local members. We take sixteencopies of THE CHAUTAUQUAN, which we consider of almost inestimablevalue in the prosecution of our work. We aim to make our meetings,which are held semi-monthly, as interesting as possible to localmembers, and therefore we select such subjects from the regular courseas are most pleasing to all. There is quite surprising unanimityof taste among us, and history, literature, and art have had thepreference for regular society work. We agree with the author of the“Preparatory Greek Course in English” in thinking that “man is apart of nature, and language the noblest outward attribute of man.”So we delight to “study man in the monuments he has left behind himfrom the distant ages, of his life and activity on the earth.” Theother branches are by no means neglected, but are studied at home orin smaller neighborhood gatherings. As a part of society work, theText-Books—some of them perfect gems—are carefully studied, and thenas carefully reviewed. The questions and answers in THE CHAUTAUQUANare always used in meetings, and an additional list of questionsis prepared by our committee of instruction, for our use. We aresufficiently informal in our proceedings to admit of considerableconversation. As we belong to the Class of 1883, we were not quitesatisfied with the amount of “Timayenis” required of us, and at ourfirst meeting in September, 1882 (this society never takes a vacation),we commenced at the beginning of the “History of Greece,” taking“Grecian Literature”—from the “Ancient Literature” which we studiedlast year—along with it. We have two or more carefully preparedpapers at each meeting. Some of the topics were “Grecian Mythology,”“The Temple Gods of the Greeks,” “The Trojan War,” “The EleusinianMysteries,” “The Greek Drama and Dramatists,” “Greek Leaders in thePersian Wars,” etc. We have just completed the history and literatureof ancient Greece, and that fascinating book, “The Preparatory GreekCourse,” and though we would gladly go on with the modern history ofthat famous land, we bid a reluctant farewell to its classic shoresand turn our attention for a while to the “Middle Kingdom.” Forseveral years previous to our adoption of the C. L. S. C. course,we had a series of lectures during the winter, by some of the besttalent that could be procured in the West. Since then, partly becausewe have been such diligent students that we could not afford the timefor the necessary arrangements, and partly because the subjects ofsuch speakers as we could obtain were not in the line of our work, wehave had no entertainments of any kind. The success, financially andotherwise, of lectures, etc., depends somewhat upon local conditions,which have not appeared favorable. This society, like all the othersbearing our name, consists entirely of ladies, but we rejoice in thesympathy and approval of all the gentlemen who are connected with us byfamily ties, some of them participating in the required reading in thehome.       *       *       *       *       *=Nevada (Carlin).=—We have six members. Our president is theinstructor. A motion prevailed at a recent meeting, “That the membersshould form themselves into a committee to go out and solicit newmembers.”       *       *       *       *       *=Montana Territory (Clancy).=—Seeing in THE CHAUTAUQUAN letters fromnearly every State in the Union, and from some of the Territories, andnot wishing to have Montana behind, I thought I would write a few linesas a representative of the C. L. S. C. in this Territory. I only knowof one circle here though there may be many more. That is in a miningcamp of about four hundred and fifty inhabitants. The circle has aboutten members. My husband and I, living on a ranch some distance from atown, form a circle, if two can form one, of our own. This is our firstyear of work and I can assure you we derive a great deal of pleasure aswell as profit from the readings. We commenced reading the day afterwe were married, and have read almost daily ever since, until we arenow ahead of the C. L. S. C., though we did not begin until the last ofOctober. Our interest in the books has taken us over the work fasterthan required; possibly it would be better for memory if we did notgo so fast. I read all THE CHAUTAUQUAN, and think there is no part inwhich I am more interested than that of the correspondents.        *       *       *       *       *=Oregon (Portland).=—We have organized out here in the far West, inthis beautiful and prosperous city, a local club of ten enthusiasticChautauquans. We have the honor, as well as the pleasure, of being thefirst organization of the kind in the State. Already the influenceof those few is beginning to be felt in different circles of societythroughout the city, so that ere another Chautauqua year commenceswe expect not only to see our own numbers greatly increased but alsoseveral new clubs. We are reading the full C. L. S. C. course. We meetevery Monday evening at the residence of some one of the members. Ourplan of program adopted is as follows: After disposing of minutes ofprevious meeting and all miscellaneous business, attention is turnedto the lesson, which is taken up in turn by each member, topics havingbeen assigned by the president one week previous, on which they are allexpected to be specially prepared on their several parts with questionsto bring out the leading and most important points, so that each inturn becomes teacher. We are highly delighted with this systematiccourse of instruction, and our interest increases with each meeting.       *       *       *       *       *=California (Moro).=—Six of the eight regular members and four localmembers are working away at the C. L. S. C. course. We are very muchinterested in the studies. Some who thought the “Greek History”and “Preparatory Greek Course” would be unprofitable, have foundthem otherwise. The questions in THE CHAUTAUQUAN are used with freeconversation upon “Astronomy” and all other works in the course.ROBIN AND I.By C. B.    Once, upon a winter day,      As I sat, forlorn and sad,    Thinking, in a fretful way,      Of the time when I was glad—    Hopping lightly o’er the snow,    Came a robin that I know.    On the window ledge he stood,      With a bright inquiring eye;    ’Twas a compact that he should      Always call in passing by,    Just to show we might pretend    Each to entertain a friend.    When I saw my tiny guest      Waiting for his daily crumb,    Dainty, trim, and self-possessed,      Never doubting it would come,    I could almost hear him say,    “Mistress, food is scarce to-day.”    And my heart made sad reply,      As the little dole I threw,    “Strange that one so poor as I      Should have store enough for two!    Robin, if the thing could be,    Would you throw a crumb to me?”    Not a sound disturbed the hush,      Save my own impatient sigh—    Robin to a neighboring bush      Darted off without good bye.    How! you leave me, faithless bird,    As I waited for a word.    Ah! I wronged that heart of flame:      Through the silence, sweet and clear,    Forth his cheery carol came,      And I held my breath to hear,    For that dear familiar strain    Woke my better self again.    Suddenly the music ceased,      Yet the silence breathed of balm;    Art thou flown, then, small hedge priest,      Somewhere else to raise the psalm?    “Man,” the Master finely said,    “Doth not live alone by bread.”    [_Not Required._]QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.

Sunday Readings, selections for April 22 and 29, in THE CHAUTAUQUAN.       *       *       *       *       *Poesy is a beauteous young lady, chaste, honorable, discreet, witty,retired, and who keeps herself within the limits of the strictestdiscretion; she is the friend of solitude, fountains entertain her,meadows console her, woods free her from ennui, flowers delight her;and, in short, she gives pleasure and instruction to all with whom shecommunicates.—_Cervantes._THOMAS HOOD.[N]I have a delightful rather than a difficult, or even a delicate dutyto perform in speaking of those remains of Hood which are not inthe keeping of the graveyard’s silent warders, but in the custodyof ever-living generations of men and women. I have at this day nointelligent opinions of Thomas Hood’s ability and achievements tooppose; no detractions from his just and symmetrical fame to rebuke;no reluctant acknowledgments of his mastership to stimulate. The mostthat can be done now for the dear, dead poet, is to waft his fame, onthe breath of honest applause, to circles of men outside of the serriedranks which have already closed in upon his shrine.It appears from the researches of his children that he was born May 23,1799.It rarely happens in the history of genius that the verdict ofposterity becomes unanimous within its own generation. Yet, this istrue of Thomas Hood. He was, indeed, broadly and lovingly appreciatedin life, and he had not been long dead when every murmur of doubt,every dissonance of judgment concerning his kingship among the humorouspoets of the nineteenth century, died away. Where now he is not admiredand extolled and loved for what he did for letters and humanities, letus charitably suppose he is only _not known_. Of him it is preëminentlytrue,    “None know him but to love him;     None name him but to praise.”I have no hesitation in making my discourse this afternoon his eulogy.If I could not have praised him as a matchless humorist, as a greatpoet, and as a noble example of manhood, I would have kept silenceconcerning him.No name in the literary annals of our century better deserves to beinscribed upon the hearts of the people than does his. He was thefriend of the people, and of all the motley he chose to wear, no garbbetter fitted him, or was more commonly worn, than that of brotherlykindness. This, indeed, he always wore, like a close-fitting tunic, andeven when the gay tissues and tinsel of Momus or Harlequin glitteredupon the outside, the cerement of charity was between them and hisbosom.The chief reputation Hood achieved in his lifetime was not that whichnow cleaves to his name. He was known and admired for what is, howeveradmirable in itself, the lesser of his two great gifts. These were witand poetry, and he shone most to the public eye in the former. I havepronounced him a matchless humorist and a great poet. The proof of mywords must be sought in his works.       *       *       *       *       *He was as peculiar in his humor as he was in his character. His passionfor punning was never exceeded, perhaps. It would have aroused all thedogmatism of Dr. Johnson’s elephantine nature to explosive indignationagainst him. Looked at superficially, very much of what Hood wroteappears to be the veriest wantoning of verbal merriment. There arewhole volumes of prose and verse, in which he seems to riot in fun, andto ransack the English language for sounds and synonyms of nonsense;but, even in his wildest abandonment to the mood of mirth, there isdiscoverable a method in his madness, a meaning in his mummery, whichis the token of a great brain, throbbing under the jester’s plume, andof a noble heart beating right humanly beneath the mummer’s spangledvest.The world at first mistook him, no doubt, for a literary harlequin, apoetical pranker, at whose antics they were called upon to laugh only.The admirable humorist lived to see their great mistake rectified, andto behold    “Laughter, holding both his sides,”not infrequently lift his restraining hands to eyes all suddenly dashedwith great blinding tears, or to a bosom growing tempestuous with sighsand throes of human sympathy.Yet there were not, I think, two distinct sides to Hood’s nature, assome of the earlier critics said, to account for the mysterious pathoswelling up from the founts of his wit, but rather a unique single,capable of many manifestations seemingly distinct and diverse, andeven antagonistic, but all alike, whether grave or gay, imaginative orpractical, comic or tragic—phases only of a homogeneous soul.It was truly said of him that he introduced comedy and tragedy to eachother, and taught them to live together in a cordial union. When hismost whimsical poems are scanned, for the discovery, not of their feet,but of their feeling, they reveal his heart beneath the rattling ribsof verbiage.In that extraordinary poem, “Miss Killmansegg and her Precious Leg,”which to the hasty or over-serious reader seems only a foolish thoughglittering pageant of rhetorical figures and fancies, a motley troopof “whims and oddities,” there is nevertheless a deep vein of wisdom,which, if visible nowhere else, leads plainly enough to the surface inthe terribly grotesque catastrophe. The heroine having lost a member bya casualty, wore instead of it a leg of gold, which she laid under herpillow at night, to keep it from the clutches of her spendthrift lord,who had hinted to her—                      —In language low,    That her precious leg was precious slow,    A good ’un to look at, but bad to go,      And kept quite a sum lying idle.    That instead of playing musical airs,    Like Colin’s foot in going up-stairs,    As the wife in the Scottish ballad declares—      It made an infernal stumping;    Whereas a member of cork, or wood,    Would be lighter and cheaper, and quite as good,      Without the unbearable thumping.Dissensions ripened into quarrels. The countess, in her anger,destroyed her will, which act hastened the dreadful end. That night hersleep was broken;—        ’Twas a stir at her pillow she felt,      And some object before her glittered.    ’Twas the golden leg!—she knew its gleam,    And up she started, and tried to scream;      But e’en in the moment she started—    Down came the limb with a frightful smash,    And, lost in the universal flash,    That her eyeballs made at so mortal a crash,      The spark, called vital departed!           *       *       *       *       *    Gold, still gold! hard, yellow and cold,    For gold she had lived, and she died for gold,      By a golden weapon—not oaken.    In the morning they found her all alone,    Stiff and bloody, and cold as a stone—    But her leg, the golden leg, was gone,      And the “golden bowl” was broken!    Gold—still gold! it haunted her yet—    At the “Golden Lion” the inquest met,      Its foreman and carver and gilder—    And the jury debated, from twelve till three,    What their verdict ought to be,    And they brought it in a _felo-de-se_,      Because her own leg had killed her!And here follows what the poet designates “Her Moral:”—    Gold! gold! gold! gold!    Bright and yellow, hard and cold,    Molten, graven, hammered and rolled,    Heavy to get, and light to hold,    Hoarded, bartered, bought, and sold,    Stolen, borrowed, squandered, doled:    Spurned by the young, but hugged by the old,    E’en to the verge of the church-yard’s mould;    Price of many a crime untold:    Gold! gold! gold! gold!    Good or bad a thousand-fold—      How widely its agencies vary,    To save, to ruin, to curse, to bless;—    As even its minted coins express,    Now stamped with the image of Good Queen Bess,      And now of a Bloody Mary.The bulk of his production is expressed with the same levity whichstrikes the ear, as in the verses just quoted. He was unquestionablythe greatest trafficker in words of double meaning the world had everknown. His stock was exhaustless, and whether home-made or far-fetched,his _mots_ and _jeux_ were sure of currency.The secret of the perpetual playfulness of his pen is to be found inthe eagerness of the public mind to be moved to mirth, and in hisneed to minister to the mood of the public mind. In a word, he wasdependent upon his brain for his bread. Labor was his law, and so, asit befel, humor and mirth became his profits. His puns (so easily spunfrom himself,) were transmuted into pence and pounds. His quips lookedquaintly ahead to quarter-day. His grotesque metaphors were sold in thestreet, like plaster images, for a livelihood. Had he been less underconstraint to please the public ear, he would have wrought, perchance,one dull epic, instead of a thousand delicious epigrams.       *       *       *       *       *His writings are indeed light, but in a double sense. They are lightwith the buoyancy of the zephyr or of the gossamer wafted in its bosom.They are light also with the luminousness of the sun-beam, kindlingbeauty and light and warmth as it flashes along its track. The writingsof Hood are to be laughed at, but they who only laugh at them haveno true appreciation of their subtle power. They disparage them fortheir mirthfulness, because they can not discover the depths below thedimpling surface of their rolling humor.       *       *       *       *       *His description of a November fog, in London, must be familiar to manyof you, but I will venture to quote it in illustration of his facilityin rhyming, and also of his skill in supplying the details of a picturewhich is all painted only in shadows.

It is the charming idyl,“RUTH.”     She stood breast-high amid the corn,     Clasped by the golden light of morn,     Like the sweetheart of the sun,     Who many a glowing kiss had won.     On her cheek an autumn flush,     Deeply ripened,—such a blush     In the midst of brown was born,     Like red poppies grown with corn.     Round her eyes her tresses fell,     Which were blackest none could tell,     But long lashes veiled a light     That had else been all too bright.     And her hat, with shady brim,     Made her tressy forehead dim;—     Thus she stood amid the stooks,     Praising God with sweetest looks:—    “Sure,” I said, “heaven did not mean     Where I reap thou shouldst but glean,     Lay thy sheaf down, and come,     Share my harvest and my home.”I hoped to find time for quoting one of his numerous ballads, inwhich he not only displays his facility in punning, and satirizes thelachrymose style of ballad verse prevalent at that period, but I mustcontent myself with reciting the oft-repeated stanza with which oneof his best ballads closes, burdened with the fate of Ben, the jiltedsailor-boy:—    His death, which happened in his berth,      At forty-odd befell:    They went and told the sexton,      And the sexton tolled the bell.If I were required to indicate that one of all Hood’s poems in whichthe humor is the maddest and merriest, I think I should, in spite ofembarrassment, choose “the tale of a trumpet,” which, like the storyof Miss Kilmansegg, rides double, and carries a moral behind it. DameEleanor Spearing, who was too excessively deaf to hear the scandalsnarrated in her presence, was beset by a peddler, who, with many artsand pleas, prevailed upon her to buy of him a marvelous ear-trumpet.From that time the dame heard sad and shocking tales at the villagefire-sides, and, of course, repeated them, until the place was filledwith “confusion worse confounded,” and in Hood’s own words:—    In short, to describe what came to pass      In a true, though somewhat theatrical way,    Instead of “Love in a Village”—alas!      The piece they performed was “The Devil to Pay.”The discovery is soon made that the dame’s diabolical trumpet has blownall this mischief, and a condign fate overtakes the unhappy old woman.She is seized by the populace and dragged to the pond just as thepeddler who sold her the horn makes his appearance, but—    “Before she can utter the name of the d—     Her head is under the water level!”The moral of the story points itself, but you can afford to listen tothe humorist’s quaint phrasing of it:    “There are folks about town—to name no names—     Who greatly resemble this deafest of dames;       And over their tea, and muffins and crumpets,     Circulate many a scandalous word,     And whisper tales they could only have heard       Through some such diabolical trumpet.”I did not interrupt the outlines of the story to illustrate itswonderful plethora of puns and pranks, but you will not be averse to amoment’s delay here for a taste of its quaint quality. It is altogethera piece of poetical pyrotechny, in which there are verbal rockets, andserpents, and stars and blue-lights, and double-headers; but, as inmany of his poems, the humor seems to go off chiefly with the giddysparkling whirl and whiz of metrical Catherine wheels. The peddlercommends his marvelous trumpet to the dame so marvelously deaf:—    “It’s not the thing for me—I know it—     To crack my own trumpet up, and blow it;     But it is the best, and time will show it.           There was Mrs. F.,           So very deaf,     That she might have worn a percussion cap,     And been knocked on the head without hearing it snap.     Well, I sold her a horn, and the very next day     She heard—from her husband at Botany Bay!     Come—eighteen shillings—that’s very low,     You’ll save the money as shillings go,—     And I never knew so bad a lot,—     By hearing whether they ring or not!     Eighteen shillings! it’s worth the price,     Supposing you’re delicate-minded and nice,     To have the medical man of your choice,     Instead of the one with the strongest voice—     Who comes and asks you how’s your liver,     And where you ache, and whether you shiver,     And as to your nerves, so apt to quiver,     As if he was hailing a boat on a river!     And then, with a shout, like Pat in a riot,     Tells you to ‘Keep yourself perfectly quiet!’”       *       *       *       *       *In Hood’s remarkable poems of passion and imagination are to be found,perhaps, his patent of nobility in the realm of poetry. But, if it wasmade out there, it has had renewal in his later poems of humanity. Itwas in the last period of his great and restless toil that he flungoff, like light fancies, some of his poems, whose stanzas will beechoed in the anthem of his undying fame. Of these are “The Lay of theLaborer,” “The Pauper’s Christmas Carol,” “The Song of the Shirt,”and “The Bridge of Sighs.” It was coincidently with the epoch of thatcomical and potential journal, _Punch_, (which has never failed topoke the heavy ribs of oppression, and to prick the great fat paunchof selfishness, in a very lively manner), that this new inspirationof brotherly kindness came to Hood. His troubled heart began to beatitself against the bars of its intellectual prison-house, and towail out its resistless pleas for the poor, the friendless, and thedesolate. “The Song of the Shirt” is one of the most extraordinarylyrics ever struck from the harp of poesy. Little thought he, however,that the lines—which, as they were written by his trembling fingers,were almost as spasmodic as if they had been literally convulsed outof his suffering frame,—little thought he that they would peal out onLondon’s ear, on England’s ear, and strike deep down into the nationalheart with a warrant for his immortality, more imperative and universalthan any which his wit had framed, or his genius had wrought, from thebeginning of his career down to the day on which he sang “The Song ofthe Shirt.”“Now, mind, Hood, mark my words, this will tell wonderfully: it is thebest thing you ever did,” said his wife, as she folded the manuscriptfor the pocket of _Punch_. And “tell” it did, for not only did Englandmake it a household ballad, but France and Germany and Italy, even,engrafted it upon their popular anthology, while here, in the NewWorld, we bear its odd burden,—    Seam, and gusset, and band,    Band, and gusset, and seam,    Stitch, stitch, stitch, and    Work, work, work,not more in our memories than in our hearts. Let us not forget,moreover, that women,    With fingers weary and worn,    With eyelids heavy and red,sent their _shillings_ from their scanty earnings all over England tohelp sculpture the pale marble that covers poor Hood on Kensall Green.Quite as remarkable as the song I have just dismissed is “The Bridgeof Sighs.” It withstood the ponderous assaults of dull-headed andcold-hearted critics when it was builded, and now its somber archeswill span the deep river of the popular feeling forever and ever. Itis a marvelously tender ode, a rare carol of charity, warbled outfearlessly, where prudish philanthropy would have drawn down its hoodand held its breath, lest, perchance, it should seem at the side of afallen woman. Now may the world lift up its head and exult that sorrow,shame, and despair have found a champion, whose voice over the    One more unfortunate,      Weary of breath,    Rashly importunate,      Gone to her death,echoes the divine verdict of Jesus of Nazareth over the sinful womanbrought to him for the stern judgment of Moses, “_Let him that iswithout sin among you cast the first stone._”       *       *       *       *       *Much remains unsaid that I would fain say. But it is time for me toclose. And what words shall I choose for last words concerning mysubject, who, if he were indeed my _subject_, would make me doublyroyal, for was not he the crowned king of kindly wits?He did not live to laugh, albeit he often laughed to live. There is,indeed, a marvel to us in his exterior mirthfulness, for he had a deepfount of sadness in his soul. The last lines of his magnificent “Ode toMelancholy” afford us the key to his inner nature:    There is no music in the life      That sounds with idle laughter solely;    There’s not a string attuned to mirth,      But has its chord in melancholy.Yet had he wept where he has laughed, had he poured forth bile insteadof humor, had he exhaled dull vapors instead of fancies, he might havemade a few miserable, but the many he has made glad would have missedthe blessed sunshine of his song and spirit.So, for his “Lays,” that yet lift us up; for his “Whims,” that we arebut too happy to indulge; for his oddities that we even admire; for his“Own,” which is yet far more ours than his; for his “Designs,” whichwere never against any one’s piece but his own; for his “Pleas,” whichpleased all classes of his clients; for his “Puns,” with which follyalone was punished; for his spirit, which was always of highest “proof”on trial; for his wit, which, witnessed of another’s, as Shaksperesays, “it ambles, it goes easily;” for his worth, that had a morningand a noon tide, though it was never (k)nighted; for his heart, whichin the chase of charity, was never be-_hind_; for his name, which isa covering of honor and a crown of bays;—for all these things, beblessings on the name and memory of Thomas Hood. [Great applause.]       *       *       *       *       *Dr. Vincent said: I am surprised and delighted to learn that aboutseventy members of the C. L. S. C. went out after fossils with ColonelDaniels before breakfast this morning. I am very glad to learn that somany of our circle are interested in this department of study.The members of the C. L. S. C. are most of them women, or a very largepart of them women, and they hear on this ground a good many thingssaid affecting woman’s sphere and work, and they hear in the course ofthe conversation a great many things said which may not be altogethertrue, in reference to the sentiments prevailing at Chautauquaconcerning this question of woman’s work and woman’s sphere. I was veryglad to know that opportunity was taken the other day to discuss oneside of that question, and I am very glad that opportunity was givento discuss the other side this afternoon. We must remember in allthis discussion, that the largest liberty is granted to all membersof the C. L. S. C., that those who believe in woman’s suffrage, andthose who are opposed to woman’s suffrage, may be equally loyal to thegreat objects of the Circle. One thing, however, must be said, thatif woman is depreciated as to her relative social power, influence,or value by the managers of the Circle, they are not worthy of yourconfidence. For the Circle which proposes to exalt the home, andincrease the intellectual power of woman as mother, and as a member ofsociety, should certainly recognize as a fundamental doctrine woman’sequality in every legitimate respect with man. [Great applause.] And,if opportunity affords for the further discussion of this question, Ihope we shall be able to avail ourselves of the opportunity, and havea thorough understanding among all members of the C. L. S. C. as towhere those of us who are most devoted to its interests stand on thesequestions. I make these remarks, in as indefinite a way as I can, thatthrough the mists you may catch the spirit of the hour, and not mistakethe true sentiment of the Chautauqua Circle.

GODWIN’S “MAN IN THE MOON.”—This amusing little work was publishedin 1638, and written by Dr. Godwin, Bishop of Llandaff in the reign ofQueen Elizabeth, and collated to the see of Hereford by her successor,King James I. It was composed when the author was a young studentat Christ Church College, Oxford, under the assumed name of DomingoGonzales. One of the prints represents a man drawn up from the summitof a mountain, with an engine set in motion by birds, which was themode in which the said Gonzales was supposed to have reached the moon.This curious and now scarce production [there is a copy of it in theBritish Museum] excited wonder and censure on its appearance, and isthought to have supplied hints to Dr. Wilkins, Bishop of Chester, incompiling his work called “A Discovery of a New World in the Moon.” Dr.Godwin is familiar to most clerical readers as author of “_PræsulesAnglicani_,” a useful referential work, and his “_Nuntius Inanimatus_”is said to have contained the first hints of a telegraph, which usefulinvention was, however, not discovered till the end of the lastcentury.AN UNNOTED EVIDENCEOF THE NECESSITY OF A REVEALED RELIGION.By REV. R. H. HOWARD, A. M.Do not the remarks of Timayenis, the author of our excellent historyof Greece, relative to the effect upon the popular faith of Greece, ofthe progress of philosophic thought, or of intellectual inquiry, (seepage 396), suggest a striking and forcible, not to say new, argument infavor of the necessity of a revealed religion—of a divinely inspiredand attested, and hence absolutely _authentic_, revelation of God’swill? His language is as follows: “But perhaps the principal reason(for the persecution of Socrates) was, that his dialectic and searchingsystem, though limited by him to human questions only, was finally_applied by his hearers_ to the _higher_ questions concerning the_creation of the universe_, and _tended to undermine the foundations ofthe prevailing religion_. The misfortune of ancient society was, thatthe popular religion was _never to be the subject of any philosophicaldebate_; either philosophy must _be left to destroy the religion, orsociety_, striving for the conservation of the latter, _must limit,as much as possible, free philosophical research_. Hence we see themost intelligent and most liberal of the Hellenic tribes continuallypersecuting, for religious reasons, the most prominent philosophers.”Our author might have better said, it seems to me, that it was themisfortune of the popular religion in ancient Hellas to be of sucha sort as not manifestly to be able successfully to abide searchingscrutiny—the white light of scientific, or philosophic, investigation.Had theirs been a religion founded on _fact_, instead of the grossestabsurdities, and embracing in their judgment only the highest,sublimest truth, instead of manifold and manifest errors, there would,clearly, have never been any occasion, on their part, to dread itsbecoming the theme of philosophical debate. Nay, the more severely itwas subjected to this ordeal of intellectual inquiry the more clearlywould its truth, evidently, be made to appear. Hence, to stand, assome people appear to, even in our day, in such mortal dread ofrationalistic, or destructive, criticism, really evinces anything but arobust,—in fact, a very slender and tottering faith, or confidence inthe divine, and hence immovable, foundations of their religion.The line of argument suggested by the foregoing quotation may bestated somewhat as follows: Early in the historical development ofa race certain religious beliefs at once spring up. These are bornof instinct. Strangely, whatever their manifest absurdity, thisfeature seems at first to constitute no serious bar to their popularacceptance. Meanwhile, palpably erroneous and absurd as many ofthese beliefs may really be, they yet, in process of time, not onlybecome deeply rooted, but come to serve certain important practicalpurposes. Meager and poor as they may be comparatively, they are yet,in point of fact, very much better than none. Without them, indeed, ordeprived of the restraining, salutary influences of the same, societyitself, perhaps, would be found to be quite impossible. Hence, as alsodoubtless from feelings of reverence therefor, a national faith, evenif it is not all that could be desired, is always jealously guarded.The man who has the temerity to introduce any religious novelties,whatever the extent to which the latter may be really an improvement onthe prevailing doctrines, will be likely to be looked upon, not onlywith suspicion, but as a public enemy, and hence, as one deservingof many stripes. “Strange gods” anciently received a no more heartywelcome or kindly hospitality than do “isms” and “heresies” generallyat the present day.Meantime, however bitter or determined may be the oppositionthus developed against it, this antagonism is by no means goingeffectually to bar out the light of truth from men’s minds. Nay, thisvery persistent and determined effort to keep it out can naturallytend only to pique curiosity, awaken suspicion and scepticism,develop opposition, and stimulate inquiry. The light must come.Meanwhile, clearly, with this gradually progressive development ofthe intellectual life of a people, and the prevalence, hence, ofa thoughtful, inquiring habit, on their part, of what, in moderntimes, is known as the “scientific spirit,” religion plainly, aswell as everything else, must come in for its share of criticism andinvestigation. And woe to it if, in this its day of judgment, it befound wanting—if, in connection with this truly crucial ordeal, itsfoundations be found to consist only of “hay, wood, and stubble.” Nay,nor does it scarcely matter what interests besides may be involved, andmust hence be sacrificed with it; it must all the same at once “stepdown and out.” The idea is that the development of brains is, in thelong run, absolutely fatal to a religion founded in error—to all thefabrics of ignorance and superstition. True, these brains can neverproduce a religion specially worthy of being substituted for the onethey have destroyed. But they can, and, in the very nature of the case,inevitably will, sooner or later, demolish and sweep utterly away anyfaith found to be fundamentally irrational and absurd.Hence, now, in order to the stability of society, and a permanent andhealthy national life,—in fact in order to all kinds of progress andof civilization, an absolutely perfect religion is necessary—one, tosay the least, that can effectually, triumphantly, abide even thekeenest search of man’s scientific ken. But, plainly, man’s unassistedgenius—no merely finite understanding—is equal to the task of producingany such religion: this “one thing” thus so supremely “needful,” yetremains; therefore, if we are to have it at all, this faith must comefrom on high.Divine interposition thus, by way of a revealed religion, is evidentlyabsolutely indispensable to prevent nations, by virtue of their veryintellectual activities, from undermining and subverting their ownfoundations, and ultimately destroying the very institutions that mightotherwise be their pride and prove as enduring as time.LOSS AND GAIN.By MRS. EMILY J. BUGBEE.        All’s lost, do we say?    When the stars of earthly hope go down,      When the light fades out in shadows gray,    When thorns grow sharp on the rugged ground,      And the birds of the summer flee away?        What’s lost?    Why, only our little throne of pride,      Only the outward trappings of life,    Only the friends that could not abide,      When sunshine faded and storms were rife.        What’s left?    Why God! and _His_ true Heaven above,      The glory of earth, and sea and air,    The deathless pulse in His heart of love,      And we to His grand estate are heir.        Infinite gain:    The riches that never more take wing,      The gold wrought out in the furnace fire,    The strength that is born of suffering,      And the upward lift of the soul’s desire.CHAUTAUQUA EMERGING FROM WINTER.A LETTER FROM CHAUTAUQUA.By the REV. VICTOR CORNELLE.We enjoy this forest life; not only through the Assembly, but throughthe delightful autumn, when we scatter the pretty leaves in everypath; through the cold, long winter and its deep and lasting snows;and through the sunny opening spring. To those who come and go, theAssembly is only a summer gathering for rest and instruction; but tous, who live here, it is like a large and stirring city passing throughour woods, and bringing with it the world’s best attainments in everydepartment of learning, the press, the telegraph, etc., and leavingbehind saloons and their train of vices. In April our quiet is usuallybroken by a few scattered families who come before to prepare theway for the thousands who are soon to follow. These increase throughJune and July and reach the climax in August. Before September closeswe can only hear the distant footsteps of a departing city; and whenwinter comes you can find but sixty small families sprinkled throughthe cottages. We had a long and pleasant fall, and work went on brisklywhile pleasant weather lasted. The Superintendent said the improvementsthis year would exceed any two previous years. The work was distributedover the grounds, but the most marked appears before the hotel, wherethe ground is worked into an easy undulating grade down to the lake.More cottages were built than usual, many enlarged and others repaired.The lake has been frozen over more than two months with ice fromfourteen to sixteen inches thick, carrying sleighs all winter. Thefishing-coops appeared in ordinary numbers, and the fishermen gazedlong through the holes cut in the ice for the fish that would not come.A few were caught.The fierceness of the winter is broken by the woods. The wind whichsweeps the snow into immense drifts outside is heard here flowing overand among the tree-tops with a deep and constant roar; but is littlefelt. The memorial bell rings with a regularity and punctuality trulygratifying to those who are expected to hear it at a distance. We caninform all Chautauquans that it rings, and the imagination alone isrequired to convey its sound to every ear, and its inspiration to everyheart. The Sabbath dawns upon us with such a peaceful quiet that itfills our hearts with reverence. Instead of being shocked by the vicesof the city, we are charmed by the innocent beauties God has thrownaround us in the works of his hands. The services held in the chapelare well attended, and the little society is gradually increasing. Thefive o’clock meetings for prayer and song in the grand and silent hallhave continued without a single break. The attendance declined throughthe hardest of the winter, but is now increasing. Our C. L. S. C. hassustained a happy existence through the quiet winter. We number twenty,meet weekly to read essays, ask questions, and exchange opinions.       *       *       *       *       *    We find this noble precept often repeated in Plato:    “Do thine own work, and know thyself.” Each member    of this sentence comprehends the whole duty of man,    and each includes the other. He who would do his own    work aright will discover that his first lesson is to    know himself and what is his duty; and he who rightly    understands himself will never mistake another man’s    work for his own, but will attend to himself, and    above all improve the faculties of his mind, will    refuse to engage in useless employments, and will get    rid of all unprofitable thoughts and schemes. And as    folly, even if it should succeed in obtaining all    that it can possibly desire, will never be satisfied,    so also wisdom, ever acquiescing in the present, is    never dissatisfied with its existing state. Epicurus    exempts the wise man from forethought and care for the    future.—_Montaigne._CHAUTAUQUA SCHOOL OF LANGUAGES.ANGLO-SAXON PRIZES.Last spring it was announced that during the session of the Schoolof Languages in ’82 two prizes would be awarded for proficiency inAnglo-Saxon acquired during the session.

ALFRED A. WRIGHT, A.M.[O]THE PURPOSES OF THIS COURSE OF STUDY.It is one purpose of the study of New Testament Greek as conductedby the Dean of the Department of Greek and the New Testament in theChautauqua School of Theology, to acquaint students with the bestmethods for obtaining an elementary knowledge of grammatical andphilological principles lying at the basis of Bible Greek.It is another purpose to acquaint students with the best methods ofusing the tools needed to mine the treasures of Greek ideas which arenot always near the surface of things.The supreme purpose of this course of study is to enable studentsto read for themselves the very _words_ which the blessed Masterand his Apostles uttered, and to so enter into the mysteries of thelanguage-forms and idioms as to behold the very _ideas_ which Christand his Apostles had before their mental eyes.He who attempts this is fascinated from the start with theanticipations of discovery and with the comforts of expected rewardfor every toil of endeavor. And, as he advances, whatever difficultiespresent themselves, appear only as the stepping-stones upon which hemay plant his ascending footsteps, and from whose loftier elevations hemay scan a wider scope of beauty.Surely—if there are hidden secrets of divine truth phrased in themetaphor or in the thought tone of the Bible Greek, the student canafford to tightly gird his loins for the journey;—it shall prove to himindeed the “Quest of the Holy Grail.”DIFFICULTIES—IN THE LANGUAGE.1. “_It is all Greek to me_,” is often said with a quality offacetiousness in tone and manner which is evidently intended as acompliment to the exceeding difficulty of learning the language. Or,it may be a _quasi_ tribute to the very picturesqueness of the Greekletters and word-forms as they appear in the sentence. Or, it maybe said by one who is overwhelmed at the erudition of some academic“Greek” flourishing a Greek Testament, and suggesting in manner acertain layman of Lynn, who once took from the parlor table a bookprinted in French, and asked his astonished hostess, “Is this Latin orFrench? For if it’s Latin I can read it.” Or it may be possible thesuperstition that the mysteries of religion are themselves in somemanner connected with the very forms of Greek words, has its influencein producing the expression; however, it is a fact that the phrase isfound on the lips of even cultured persons, “_It’s all Greek to me_.”2. _Misapprehension._—The fact is, many people misapprehend the natureof the language and of the real difficulties in the way of masteringits secrets. For the new scholar will invariably assert that Greek,especially New Testament Greek, is _not_ a difficult study, because ofthe language forms or idioms. The _real_ difficulties are to be foundin other places, than in the gardens of the text.THE REAL DIFFICULTIES.1. _Lack of Early School Training._—Here is a real difficulty whichmany Sunday-school teachers and others _feel_. Unquestionably, however,they too much magnify it. An undertaking may be difficult and yetpossible. Its difficulty may be over-estimated. A lack of early or thebest school training, seriously affects one’s future success in lettersor in art. But if there be will and energy and perseverance in a man,these will go far toward insuring his success, while he who has themnot will surely fail though blessed with every advantage of school andteacher.Elihu Burritt, blacksmith, learned eighteen languages and twenty-twodialects, because he _would_ learn them, not because he had earlyscholastic advantages.Shakspere says,              “It is not in our stars    But in ourselves, that we are underlings.”2. _Lack of Time._—With busy pastors, superintendents and teachers,this difficulty is a _real_ one. Nevertheless we may hint to _some_pastors that their busy-ness is largely misdirected. It is certainthere is time enough to do all that God wants you or needs you todo. But to elaborate the sixth topic of a thirty minute discourseupon the anvil of three weeks’ time, and to do nothing else must bepronounced at least doubtfully wise or valuable. Or, to “run in andsee” the mince-pie making Martha or the floor-scrubbing Patience orthe boudoir-adorning Evelyn and her æsthetic sister Elsie, and to donothing else, may please the dear creatures and make one the mostpopular pastor for the village ages, but is _this_ wise or valuable?[Hint. _They who “run in” may “run out.”_] A New York _Sun_ reporterin describing the proceedings of the last Democratic State Convention,coined a new word,—not elegant indeed, but extremely expressive. “TheHon. —— arose and proceeded to _peppersauce himself_ all over theconvention.” Certainly this is a most emphatic use of the middle formof a noun-verb, and is indefinitely suggestive of the very actionand _distributive energy_ of the Hon. ——’s speech as well as of thespeecher. The _number_ of parish calls made per year is not the onlymeasure of a pastor’s value to his church. We must have the _qualis_ aswell as _quantus_ of his work if we would make a fair test of values.But the quantity of this work is the very consumption of time. Probablyyou could both learn Greek and make better pastoral calls if you shouldrefrain from distributing yourself so continuously over the parish.Wesley’s rule, “Be diligent. Never be unemployed. Never be _triflingly_employed. Neither spend more time at any place than is strictlynecessary,” is one of universal wisdom. Kirke White learned Greek whilewalking to and from a lawyer’s office.A nail cutter was at work cutting nails at his machine in the mill;the long stick that held his pincers was grasped in his right hand andthe other end of it, running between his side and elbow, was slung ina cord pendent from the floor above. The red-hot nail plates glowed inthe fire, ready to be seized one by one in the pincers, as the workmanfinished feeding the last one into the closing jaws of the machine.Only a minute’s time and a single nail plate—turned for every nailby the deft hand of the skilled artisan, and fed accurately, becamenails. The workman was so adjusted in mental tether to his work thatthe jaws never closed upon the iron pincers. With a single motion therefuse bit within the pincers fell amongst its fellow scraps, and a newplate began its course. And all the while _the workman was reading abook_. The babel of two hundred crunching jaws around availed nothingto disturb him. He’d planned to save time. He didn’t mean to becomemachinery or a machine. _That man could learn Greek._    [To be continued.]EDITOR’S OUTLOOK.The C. L. S. C. as a Substitute for the College.The C. L. S. C. has been called the “People’s College.” That it isindeed a school for the thousands who pursue its course of study noone has questioned. Some, however, of the more exact of speech mightdoubt the propriety of applying the dignified name of college to aninstitution of its character. We do not set up any claims on the groundof derivation from the Latin verb _colligere_, to collect or bringtogether, for then would the C. L. S. C. outrank all other collegesin the world. Nor do we plead the right to use such a name because ofthe scores of institutions chartered under the name of college, whichscarcely bear comparison for character and grade of instruction withour academies and best high schools. Let us be content to speak ofplain, unpretentious C. L. S. C. as a substitute for the respectablecollege.The warmest enthusiast for the C. L. S. C. has never recommended itto young men and women with means and opportunity to pursue a regularcollege course. On the contrary it has been a claim from the beginningthat it tends to arouse in many a home the ambition to have son anddaughter enjoy the advantages of the college training. But to thethousands of C. L. S. C. students to whom opportunity is past, or towhom it never came for want of time and money, to those and otherthousands of well wishers it will be of interest to consider how and towhat extent the C. L. S. C. may be deemed a substitute.It should be borne in mind that the college proper is entirely distinctfrom the professional school. The former aims to give that generaland accurate knowledge and training which prepares for the work andduties of life. The latter is wholly technical in its character. Now,keeping this definition in view and comparing the C. L. S. C. with thecollege, we shall see that each possesses its points of superiorityand inferiority. The college has facilities for taking the student ofphysics and chemistry into apparatus-room and laboratory where he maywitness experiment and illustration of great practical value. The C.L. S. C. student reaches the same facts and conclusions through thecuts and explanations of text-books, supplemented in many cases byexperiments of his own, which, though rude, are often the most valuableof all. All that acquaintance with the operations and formulæ of highermathematics which the college student with taste and talent for suchthings may possess, the C. L. S. C. student does not have. But theresult wrought out through these higher mathematical processes withall their various practical applications are brought to his knowledge.The C. L. S. C. student does not have the benefit of a critical studyof Latin and Greek, but he gets through history and the literaturesof these languages as large an acquaintance with Greece and Rome.Horace Greeley, when reminded of the impossibility of his obtaining agood knowledge of the old classic authors because of his ignorance ofthe languages in which they wrote, replied that he did not think itnecessary to eat a few feet of “lead pipe every day in order to geta pint of Croton water.” Whatever may be the strength or weakness ofsuch reasoning it must be admitted that acquaintance with the thoughtand feeling of mankind is the highest fruit of language study. This,through faithful and scholarly translations, the C. L. S. C. studentreceives.In the departments of general history and English literature the C. L.S. C. has a wider range and requires more than the college. It has itsspecial courses which correspond with the idea of elective studies inthe more advanced colleges of the times. The C. L. S. C. possesses,too, the advantages of all the improved methods of instruction, so faras circumstances will permit of their application: the lecture, thetext-book, the question and answer. The student may lose something byreason of the long distance in miles between himself and the authoror lecturer who is his teacher, but he is somewhat compensated by thebetter facilities which he possesses for the development of habits ofpersonal investigation and self-reliance. The C. L. S. C. is not thecollege but in many features it is like the college. It is the bestsubstitute for it known.Wagner.The recent death of Richard Wagner removes from the world of art one,the greatness of whose work it would be difficult to exaggerate. Hismusical devotees, who are in every land, and who pay him the mostenthusiastic homage, regard his loss as irreparable. The art of musichas perhaps had no follower who in all respects was his equal. Hisimpression upon his age was deep, and his work will not soon pass away.He died February 13, in Venice, where he was spending the winter. Forsome years he had been accustomed, as the season of cold came on, toseek the milder Italian climate.May 22, 1813, in Leipsic, Wilhelm Richard Wagner was born, the youngestof seven children. His father was an actuary of police, and died a fewmonths after the son’s birth. A step-father, Ludwig Geyer, a portraitpainter, who had once been an actor and a writer of plays, probablyhelped in giving his mind a dramatic bent, but he also died whenRichard was but seven years old. Wagner, in his autobiography, tellsus that, though he early discovered a strong taste for music, he couldnever learn to play well on the piano. His teacher in boyhood declaredthat his making a player was quite out of the question, and the teacherwas right. His playing was never good. He was sent to school to preparefor the regular university course; but here his time was largely spentin verse-making, in studying the Greek and other tragedies, and writingplays. He passed among his school fellows for one of bright mind, andhe excelled in literary work. Before he had reached his twelfth yearverses of his appeared in print. It was a memorable time with theboy when a translation of Shakspere’s works fell into his hands. Hisadmiration for the great genius of English literature knew no bounds;he studied English that he might read the plays in the original. Hebecame an earnest student of this master, and it was his delight to sitat his feet. One of his biographers, speaking of this boyhood period,says that “He projected an immense tragedy, which was a concoctionof ‘Hamlet’ and ‘King Lear,’ on an absurdly grand scale. Forty-twomen died in the earlier part of the play, and he was obliged to makea number of them return as ghosts, in order to keep the last actssufficiently supplied with _dramatis personæ_.” Another event in hislife was his first hearing at a concert one of Beethoven’s symphonies.The lad of fifteen was deeply moved, and a purpose to be a musician wasawakened in his soul. His friends had no faith in his musical gifts,but finally allowed him to follow his inclination. He set to studyingmusic at a furious rate, and to composing music. He studied for a timeat the Thomas-schule at Leipsic, but in a desultory fashion at first,from which he derived little good. At length, however, he put himselfunder the instruction of Theodore Weinlig, cantor of this seminary,—athoroughly competent teacher,—and laid an excellent foundation for hismusical future. He became an adorer of Beethoven, as he had been—andcontinued ever to be—of Shakspere. “I doubt,” wrote one musical critic,“whether there ever was a young musician who knew Beethoven’s worksmore thoroughly than Wagner at his eighteenth year. The master’sovertures and larger instrumental compositions he had copied forhimself in score. He went to sleep with the sonatas and rose with thequartettes; he sang the songs and whistled the concertos.”The success of Wagner did not come speedily. He was forced to waita long time for the world’s appreciation. There were years in whichfailure followed failure with him as a musical director and composer.He struggled long with poverty. He received his share of ridicule. Butthe time of his triumph came. His music has gone everywhere, and inthese last years people from all quarters of the globe have flockedto the little Bavarian city where he had his home to listen to theproductions of his genius as rendered by the world’s first artists.The coming of King Ludwig to the throne of Bavaria meant for Wagnerhis needed opportunity. The young king believed in him and took himunder his protection. He could show the world at length the powerthat was in him. And the world has acknowledged it, and crowned himking in the realm of music. He founded a school; his theories werenew and revolutionary. And his school has triumphed; his theories, asone has said, have “leavened the whole lump of European music.” Hisgreat name was sought to add to the glory of our American Centennialin 1876, and a portion of the music sung at the opening of the greatexhibition in Philadelphia was from his pen. He was more than a musicalcomposer. He was a matchless orchestral organizer and director. Hewas possessed of exquisite dramatic insight. He was a poet of genuinepoetic gifts. He was a profound writer upon political and philosophicalsubjects. And his writings upon music and the drama have had a greatinfluence. His literary works have been collected and published in anedition of nine volumes, and show in their author a strangely versatilegenius. Some of his best known musical compositions are “Rienzi,”“Tannhäuser,” “Lohengrin,” “Tristan und Isolde,” “Die Meistersinger,”the four operas of the “Nibelungenring,” whose presentation enrapturedthousands attended at Baireuth—among whom were different crowned headsof Europe—and “Parsifal” given last July at the same place with equalor greater success. Wagner lived in his last years at Baireuth in royalstyle. If fame, wealth, the homage of men could give man content, hislot should have been one of satisfaction. Personally, he was a man ofstrong will, of self-assertion, and of stubbornness—a man who could sayof others things harsh and severe. Among his friends, however, he wasamiable and often jolly. He was twice married. His first wife was not acongenial partner, and was divorced. His second was the daughter of theillustrious Liszt, and she survives him.The Study of Art.Within the last decade there has been in this country a marked increasein the interest manifested in all matters pertaining to the fine arts.Not only have amateur artists been multiplied all over the land, butmany persons who make no pretensions to the use of brush or chisel,have applied themselves assiduously to the study of the history andprinciples of art. Each succeeding year adds to the number.Of late years, also, the facilities for such studies have been greatlyincreased. In many of our universities and colleges departments of arthave been instituted and capable instructors secured to train suchstudents as desire to acquire thorough knowledge. In addition to this,societies are to be found in most of our leading cities, which aredesigned to encourage the study of art and afford great facilities tothose desiring to perfect themselves in its different departments. Atleast one school of design has been established in this country, whichhas already attracted many students. Instructions in oil and watercolors can be obtained in almost every town and hamlet in the land.Opportunities are numerous and afford delightful and profitable pastimefor those who have leisure and capacity for such employments.The study of art has been given suitable prominence in the course ofthe C. L. S. C. Text-books, well written and beautifully illustrated,have been prepared by persons in every way qualified for the taskthey have undertaken. Numerous lectures on this subject, full ofentertainment and instruction, have been delivered on the Chautauquaplatform, while the Chautauqua Schools of Drawing and Modeling are eachyear increasing in interest and attendance. A number of articles onvarious departments of art have appeared in THE CHAUTAUQUAN, and itsfuture numbers will be enriched by many more.The study of art in all its departments is worthy of the highestcommendation and encouragement, and is always productive of beneficialresults. It is ennobling and elevating in its tendencies. It is theherald of a broader culture, of a greater refinement of taste andmanners, and a higher degree of civilization. Its practical resultswill be made manifest in more beautifully built and more tastefullyadorned homes, in a truer æstheticism, and in a keener appreciation ofthe beautiful in nature, life, and morals.Increased study and admiration of a subject is always productive ofdesire to possess and enjoy its works. The great acquisition of wealthin recent years by the people of this country affords ample means togratify this noble desire awakened by this study. Hence the demand forworks of art has greatly increased, so that the artist who is able toproduce well-executed pictures or statues is sure of a profitable andeven lucrative employment. Genius in this realm, as well as elsewhere,is rare; but patient and persistent effort on the part of any onepossessed of even moderate ability, will enable its possessor to attainto sufficient excellence to insure a fair degree of success in anartistic career.It is true that works of art will always be, as regards the cost ofproduction, beyond the means of those in ordinary circumstances, butnot on this account should persons in the humble walks of life bedeterred from the study of art. The benefits received from such acourse of study are as sure to be obtained by the poorest as by therichest. But while paintings and statuary may be too costly for themany, photographs and engravings of the masters, both in painting andsculpture, can be obtained for comparatively small sums. The humblestand poorest need not be without the inspiration derived from themarvelous designs of the great artists who, from age to age, havedelighted the world with their wonderful works.Art galleries, which constitute one of the chief attractions ofEuropean cities to cultured tourists, do not abound in our country,but art exhibitions are occasionally within the reach of all, andshould be attended whenever possible by every one who desires to attainproficiency in the study and knowledge of art.Washington Irving.A hundred years have gone since the birth of this genial writer, towhom we owe so great a debt. The Irving centenary will occur on April3, and this number of THE CHAUTAUQUAN affords a most fitting place forProf. Bruce’s eloquent lecture upon his writings. We would also makeroom here for a résumé of his life and work.The life of this favorite author is comprised between the dates April3, 1783, and November 28, 1859. He lived reasonably long, and hisyears were eminently fruitful. His birth-place was New York city,and he died at his “Sunnyside” place, famous and beloved, on theHudson. His parents were English, which may partly account for thewarm side he ever had for the English people. He was the youngest ofseveral children. His early educational advantages were good, andwell improved. At the age of sixteen he entered upon the study oflaw. The bent of his mind, however, was toward literature. As earlyas 1802 he wrote for the press, and among other effusions a seriesof articles in the _Morning Chronicle_, signed “Jonathan Oldstyle,”came from his pen. In 1804 he was threatened with consumption, andvisited Europe in pursuit of health. At Rome he made the acquaintanceof the great painter, Washington Allston, with whom he set out to studyfor an artist. The new passion, however, was short-lived. A trial ofthree days satisfied him that he was not born to wield the brush. Onhis return from his European trip he was admitted to the bar, butinstead of seeking law-practice he devoted his time to literary work.The first of his published works which was important was the serial“Salmagundi”—the joint production of his brother William, James K.Paulding, and himself—the first number of which was issued in January,1807. This humorous work, abounding in clever hits at persons andthings, was very successful, and was received with favor on the otherside of the Atlantic as well as at home. The exquisite “Knickerbocker’sHistory of New York” soon followed, a burlesque which was taken forveritable history by some rather dull readers, and gave offense tocertain descendants of the old Dutch families. Irving’s brother Peterhad some hand, though quite a subordinate part, in the construction ofthis work. After the publication of “Knickerbocker,” nothing of muchimportance came from his pen for a number of years. After his father’sdeath, two of Irving’s brothers succeeded to his important mercantilebusiness, and he himself became a sleeping partner in the firm. In1815 he again visited Europe. He became a resident of London. There hefound himself favorably known by his works, and became intimate withmany of the literary men of the day. The time came when his firm becamebankrupt, and he was obliged to take hold of literary work in earnestfor a livelihood. In 1820 “Geoffrey Crayon’s Sketch-Book” was publishedin London, at the time it was also appearing in America. “BracebridgeHall” and “Tales of a Traveler” afterward appeared at intervals of twoyears. In 1824 he was prepared to gratify a desire for travel, and heproceeded to make a protracted tour of the continent. This finished,he took up his residence in Spain, where he collected materials forhis “Life of Columbus,” “The Conquest of Granada,” and “The Alhambra,”which works were published in the order named. In 1829 he returned toLondon, and the second year following he received from the Universityof Oxford the degree of LL.D. After an absence of seventeen years,he returned to his native land in 1832. In this time he had becomea bright star in the world’s literary firmament. His countrymen,proud of his great fame, extended to him a royal welcome. He built“Sunnyside,” near Tarrytown, N. Y., where he loved to entertain hisliterary and other friends, and here he passed the remaining years ofhis life. His pen continued busy. The other works he gave to the worldare “Astoria,” “Captain Bonneville,” “Life of Goldsmith,” “Mahomet andhis Successors,” and “The Life of Washington.” The last work he hadjust time to finish before sudden death commanded his pen to perpetualsilence.Irving was the first American author to be known and admired inEurope. He has remained in England the favorite among our writers. Hisextended fame is well merited, and now that nearly a quarter-centuryhas gone since his death, it does not seem to wane. His writingsare to be admired for their classic English, their beauty of style,their sweet and genial spirit, their sparkling humor, their pure andnoble thoughts. While he lived six hundred thousand volumes of hisworks were sold in our land alone, and since his death their sale hasaveraged more than thirty thousand volumes yearly. And such a tokenof appreciation is no more than his due. In his personal character hewas one of the most estimable of men. His life was without reproach.He lived and died in the Christian faith. He was a man of largehospitality, and the most winning courtesy. His affections were strongand his nature generous. He never married. A young lady, to whom in hisyouth he was attached, was removed by death, and his heart was nevergiven to another. Well does the “Easy Chair” of _Harper_ call for theerection of an Irving statue in Central Park. And it is most fittingfor the lovers of his writings, who are uncounted thousands, to paysome observance to the centenary of this author, through whom it firstbecame known to the trans-Atlantic world that in America was the powerto produce a literature.EDITOR’S NOTE-BOOK.It will be good news to readers of THE CHAUTAUQUAN that Mrs. G. H.Cook, of Boston, Mass., has kindly consented to come to our rescueby taking up the story of the “Tour Round the World,” where sicknessobliged Mrs. Mary Lowe Dickinson to give it up. Mrs. Cook traveledleisurely with her husband, the Rev. Joseph Cook, on his recent tourround the world, and she made voluminous notes on points of interestin every land they visited. Her articles, which will appear in THECHAUTAUQUAN for May, June, and July of the current volume, will beof special interest. She will start from Italy and go to Greece andPalestine, thence to Egypt and India, then through China and Japan. Shewill give us the latest and best things that can be gathered on thisline of travel.       *       *       *       *       *In the Quincy, Michigan, local circle, a new feature has beenintroduced into the program for a regular meeting, viz., _a paper on“current events of the week.”_ This will educate the members to observepassing events, and to study their bearings on our civilization. Itwill awaken a new interest in reading the daily and weekly papers,and excite members to _learn_ to read the papers. It will remove theobjection that is sometimes made that so much ancient history in the C.L. S. C. course is dry and uninteresting, by giving present history.It is, however, a _departure_ that should be indulged in with care,because we may let a taste for current events destroy a taste for themore substantial history of the past, which has been prepared by themasters, and is set all around with the _results_ grown out of theevents. Yet a paper on _current events of the week_ is a good kind ofpaper for a local circle.       *       *       *       *       *The Star Route trial, No. 2, at Washington, goes on and on. Rerdell,who was ex-Senator Dorsey’s book-keeper, has turned against hisemployer and confessed under oath that he had perjured himself onthe witness stand in the first trial. There is no doubt but there iscrime under the indictments in this case, if it can be located, andthat is what the government is now trying to do. It is humiliatingthat a powerful organization like the United States government shouldbe obliged to consume so much time and be at such enormous expense toprove the guilt or innocence of the few men involved in this case.Attorney General Brewster has endured a severe storm of criticism fromsympathizers with the accused; while Mr. Ingersoll, who has been usinghis wits to point out the mistakes of Moses, has now, as Mr. Dorsey’scounsel, assumed the task of showing up the mistakes of the UnitedStates government. The embarrassment seems to be that while an increasein the mailing facilities of the West was needed, more of an increasewas made than was economical or just. To fasten the injustice where itbelongs is the task of the trial.       *       *       *       *       *A certain class of Presbyterian ministers in this country perpetuatethe old custom of wearing a gown in the pulpit. The Rev. Dr. Paxton,and the Rev. Dr. John Hall, of New York, are among the number.The Rev. Dr. W. H. DePuy, for many years associate editor of the NewYork _Christian Advocate_, has resigned his position, to devote histime to the “People’s Cyclopædia.” Dr. DePuy has made a fine reputationas a wise and enterprising editor, a clear and strong writer. He willbe greatly missed in the columns of the _Advocate_. Dr. Buckley,the editor-in-chief, is to have Mr. Dougherty, a layman, and formercritical proof reader, for his associate in Dr. DePuy’s place.       *       *       *       *       *Mr. B. C. Herrick, of Akron, graduated in the C. L. S. C. clans of1882, but, by some mistake, his name did not appear in the publishedlist.       *       *       *       *       *We are prepared to supply back numbers of the present volume of THECHAUTAUQUAN. We can also fill orders for the CHAUTAUQUA ASSEMBLY DAILYHERALD of 1882. Persons writing for the ASSEMBLY HERALD should becareful to say which volume, 1882 or 1883.       *       *       *       *       *The _Scientific American_ says: “The reappearance of the variable starpoetically known as the Star of Bethlehem is among the possibilities ofthe present year; for unless astronomical calculations are in fault,this long-looked for star must flash forth from the sky-depths beforethe year 1885 has completed its course, and it may appear at any time,as its period, if it have one, is very near completion.”       *       *       *       *       *The poem by Charlotte E. Leavitt on the “Comet” in THE CHAUTAUQUAN forMarch, reads “The first faint _flashes_ of the coming morn.” It shouldread “_flushes_.”       *       *       *       *       *“The circle has been a factor in making ‘_two hearts beat as one_.’”The above message is frequently received at the office of THECHAUTAUQUAN; this time, the address of Miss Maggie Barclay became Mrs.Fred. S. White, Minneapolis. Her name was changed, while her husbandhis name retained, February 20. “What don’t the C. L. S. C. help peopleto do?”       *       *       *       *       *While eminent men in political life are occasionally seen going toruin, through their own weakness, or by the treachery of their formerassociates, it brightens the picture to see a man like ex-GovernorEdwin D. Morgan, of New York, finish his course and come to his deathlike a Christian, patriot, and philanthropist. He called the Chicagoconvention together that nominated Abraham Lincoln for the Presidency;as the war Governor of New York he sent 273,000 of her sons as soldiersinto the Union army, and twice did he refuse to become Secretary of theTreasury of the United States. He left an estate estimated to be worth$6,000,000, of which he gave $795,000 to various benevolent objects.       *       *       *       *       *The interest taken in the “Wiggins storm” was about as phenomenal asthe storm itself. Less than a year ago Barnum, an American, awakenedand excited the people of two great nations over Jumbo. This time itwas an Englishman who prophesied, ostensibly basing his predictionson scientific calculations, that a _tremendous_ storm would sweepover certain portions of the earth on the 10th and 11th of March. Astorm came, but it was the old kind of a March storm. The people ofKansas, Dakota, and other portions of the West see greater storms oncea month. We are a foolish people—ready to believe many foolish things,if they come in the name of science. The correct philosophy of stormshas not been formulated. Scientists are unable to tell us much abouttheir origin or end; herein they are in accord with the greatest ofteachers—who has said, “The wind bloweth where it listeth, and thouhearest the sound thereof but canst not tell whence it cometh orwhither it goeth.”Congress has adjourned. In the Senate, Senator Davis resigned hispresidency in season for the Republicans to elect Senator Edmundsto his place, thus preparing against an emergency. In the case ofPresident Arthur’s death Mr. Edmunds would succeed to the Presidencyof the United States. The tariff absorbed the most attention andconsumed the most time of both houses near the close of the session.On this question the great political parties are choosing their groundpreparatory to the next presidential campaign.       *       *       *       *       *The Buffalo, Pittsburg & Western Railroad Company has purchased the“Transit Line of Steamers” on Chautauqua Lake. The Chautauqua travelingpublic are to be congratulated on this change, for this corporationhas already shown much enterprise in the extension of their line ofrailroad to the Chautauqua grounds. Under the management of thiscorporation we may reasonably expect that profanity and intemperance,which vices have been too common on Chautauqua steamers, will besuppressed. We shall now hope for a better administration.       *       *       *       *       *No author of the C. L. S. C. has been more of a friend to us all thanJohn Richard Green, the author of “Green’s Short History of the EnglishPeople.” It is with sorrow that we chronicle his death. In the firstyear of the course we read his work. Mr. Green had the rare facultyof viewing history with a philosophical eye, and of describing itsevents and results in a lively, entertaining style. We have seen pageafter page of his writings read before a class of young people withouttheir interest flagging for a moment. The man who can so write for thepeople, does more for his race than many investigators and critics.Though a popular writer, Mr. Green’s position as examiner in the Schoolof Modern History, Oxford, proves his exact and critical knowledge. Nohistorian who has recently died will be mourned by a greater number ofpeople, and the C. L. S. C. will especially feel his loss.       *       *       *       *       *Miss Helen Winsor, of Jamestown, N. Y., is a young lady who has beenafflicted in body for many years, but not to an extent to prevent thecultivation of her taste for works of art. We remember some beautifulcrayon sketches she wrought on the blackboard for a Sunday-school whenshe was a mere girl. She is now with friends in Philadelphia pursuingthe study of art, and doing some excellent work with her own brush. Welearn that she proposes to open a studio there for work, and for thesale of her paintings.       *       *       *       *       *In this number of THE CHAUTAUQUAN our readers will find a newdepartment under an old name. Turn to the “Editor’s Table” and you willsee that we anticipate the questions of the questioners. The suggestionwas made by a local circle in California—we have mislaid the letter—andemphasized by Dr. Vincent. We have therefore decided to try to throwa stronger light on the dark parts of the required readings in the C.L. S. C. course of study. This is not to be understood as a reflectionon the authors who write for the C. L. S. C., but rather a necessitywhich grows out of the fact that our writers put much in little, asPlutarch says, “give the sense of things;” hence it is important thatwe supplement their articles with the pronunciation of hard words,explanatory notes, etc. It is the old “Editor’s Table” with thisdifference: we do not wait for our readers to send in their questionsfor answers; we anticipate them by a critical reading and re-readingof the articles, and then make the notes as you will find them in thisnumber.       *       *       *       *       *_The Watchman_ is a neatly printed and ably edited little paper issuedmonthly by the Rev. E. K. Creed, for the benefit of his church atSilver Creek, N. Y. This is a better method than the “tract,” socalled, in a congregation. It is fresh every month, and useful as theorgan of every society in the church. It affords a splendid opportunityfor the pastor to emphasize ideas and plans for church work. We areacquainted with four large churches where a little paper of thischaracter has been made the medium for a vesper and praise service on aSunday evening once a month. The Scriptures are selected and arrangedfor responsive readings by pastor and congregation, and two or threeverses from about six hymns, set to tunes that the people know, areinterspersed through the readings. It makes a delightful half-hourservice, which may be followed by a fifteen or twenty minute address bythe pastor. It breaks up monotony, introduces a pleasing variety intochurch services, and educates the people to read the Scriptures andsing the songs of the Church.       *       *       *       *       *No argument strikes harder than one of figures, and such the Rev.Joseph Cook has recently given us in his powerful preludes to hisBoston Monday lectures. He shows us that one-third of our children aregrowing up in ignorance; that the liquor traffic for a day equals themissionary collections for a year. He proves our needs, and tells uswhat must be done. Trite and tiresome as the topics appear to many,upon the success or failure of them depend all national and Christianhealth. For many years these questions must be discussed, but thelonger indifference is manifested, the harder it will be to uproot theevil results growing with such fearful rapidity in our nation.       *       *       *       *       *Mr. J. B. Rogers, of Dundee, N. Y., writes the following: In companywith a few ladies and gentlemen of the geology class, I visited PanamaRocks last summer. The questions were asked, how were they formed?To what system do they belong? and a number of other questions ofsimilar import. Undoubtedly a great many persons have asked the samequestions before. From the few observations which my limited visitafforded me, I came to the conclusion that the conglomerate was anoutlier of the lowest conglomerate of the carboniferous system and thatthe adjacent portions had been removed by denudation. After reachinghome I found that Prof. James Hall, in his report on the geology ofthe fourth district of the State of New York, held the same view. Therock at Panama is about 60 feet thick. The stratum in Pennsylvania, afew miles south of the State line, is 150 feet thick. In the statesof Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky, the same rock is about 100 feet thick.It “thins out” toward the west, showing that the locality from whichthe materials of the conglomerate were obtained, was situated to theeast. In fact, the rocks of New York and Pennsylvania, in the majorityof cases, thin out toward the west; showing that while they were beingdeposited, there existed a large region of land surface to the east,from which the material of the rocks was derived. On the summits ofthe two highest hills over which the road passes from Chautauqua toPanama, the same conglomerate is found, affording an excellent exampleof erosion, for the intervening rock has been removed. The rock atPanama has evidently dropped down. Imagine an over-hanging cliff ofconglomerate, the soft greenshale being worn away by water, underminingthe conglomerate. It falls, and is broken in great blocks. Theadjoining portions are worn down and carried away, as the rock is nowbeing worn. The portions between Panama and Chautauqua are evidently_in situ_. I have been informed that on the north side of the lake adetached mass of conglomerate caps the hill.       *       *       *       *       *Our country has been terribly visited during the last month by floodsof enormous extent. In all the suffering and loss there has beenmarked sympathy and aid. While the waters were devastating the banksof the Rhine, Ohio sent contributions to the suffering people. Hardlywere these evidences of friendliness received before Cincinnati wassubmerged and over the ocean came help from the Rhine. Certainlyinternational brotherhood is fast increasing, and we are on the highwayto unity.       *       *       *       *       *A member of the C. L. S. C. complains of discrepancies between themeasurements given in the text-book on astronomy and those in THECHAUTAUQUAN. Our friend must not forget that when doctors disagree itis hard to be exact. In regard to the velocity of light various resultshave been reached. Foucault gives it 185,000 miles, and Newcomb saysthis is probably within 1,000 miles of the truth. Again, 185,200 isgiven; 186,250; 191,000. The _exact_ diameter of the sun and its volumeas compared with the earth is not known. The figures are approximate.As to the number of comets, the text-book refers to all the cometsvisible to naked eye and observed by telescope, and the discrepancywill disappear when it is noticed that THE CHAUTAUQUAN makes adivision; the total being 700, which agrees with the text-book.EDITOR’S TABLE.The following notes on the Required Readings for April make a newfeature of “THE CHAUTAUQUAN” which we expect will be a regulardepartment for the use of readers and circles that have neither timenor books to look up the classic allusions, definitions, or dark pointsof articles. They are intended to contain what would be required ofstudents in a recitation, and should be used by leaders of circles assubjects for questions. It is earnestly desired by the Counselors ofthe C. L. S. C. that the course shall be pursued thoroughly, hence theobject of this department is to help all members, but especially thosethat are doing thorough work.The notes will stand in the order of the articles as found in theRequired Readings for the month, the page and column being given. “P.”will stand for page; “c.” for column.“HISTORY OF RUSSIA.”P. 365, c. 1.—“Tatar.” Also written Tata; the correct, though unusualforms of the word Tartar, supposed to be of Chinese origin.P. 365, c. 1.—“1224-1264.” Contemporaneous with these invasions we haveHenry III. in England, holding the first regular parliament, and fixingweights and measures for his kingdom.

An invasion ofthe English occurring, the blacks joined the Spanish against them,Toussaint being the leader; but in the midst of hostilities, Franceoffered to free the slaves with the understanding that the island beunder her control. Toussaint, favoring this, brought all parties sospeedily to his opinion, that the French leader exclaimed: “This manmakes an opening (l’ouverteur) everywhere:” whence this surname of“l’Ouverteur.” Afterward he became the ruler of the island. Having senta constitution to Bonaparte, the latter was incensed, and sent an armyagainst him.

Few or no notes of definition or explanationare needed, for the article is very clear. There is, however, apossibility of making the subject of much more value by a few simpleobservations and experiments, such as are in the reach of everylocal circle and student. We give a few hints which may be extendedindefinitely.P. 375, c. 1.—“Tissues.” To study the tissues a microscope should beused. A circle might, with little expense, buy a small microscope,it would be of infinite value in their future studies. If this isout of the question, borrow one of a physician or, at least, furnishyourselves with lenses, also a set of scalpels. Specimens can easilybe obtained to illustrate the structure of the tissues. By a skillfuluse of the microscope and knives the subject will cease to be hard anduninteresting. A fowl carefully dissected illustrates the tendons,ligaments of the fibrous tissue. Muscular tissue is well seen in apiece of beef. The structure of nervous tissue and course of the nervesmay be studied in any small animal. Adipose tissue, or fat, is easilyobtained.P. 375, c. 1.—“Skeleton.” To thoroughly understand the human skeleton,one should, if possible, be obtained for study; if this be impossible,there are excellent charts printed which are good substitutes. Bothfailing, we would advise a visit to the butcher, who can easily obtainfor you the spinal column and other bones of a vertebrate animal.Thus can be seen the strength, elasticity, and general motion of theback-bone, also the shape of the vertebræ, how they fit together andthe distribution of nerves. The femur, leg bones, etc., will also befound, it is true, in a modified form, but yet so that they can beeasily recognized from the descriptions. It is well in studying thejoints to obtain fresh specimens, for then the ligaments and tendonsare also well illustrated.P. 375, c. 1.—“Muscular action.” A frog is a convenient subject forobserving the motion of muscles. If a small battery is used, theresults are interesting.P. 376, c. 1.—“Sebaceous,” se-bā´shus.P. 376, c. 1.—“Æsophagus,” æ-soph´a-gus.P. 376, c. 1.—“Pepsin,” pĕp-sin. It is prepared artificially fromrennet.P. 376, c. 2.—“Emŭlsion.” A soft liquid resembling milk.P. 376, c. 2.—“Stomach;” “intestine.” In all mammals the alimentarycanal has the same general structure and arrangement as in man. If itis possible to obtain a large specimen it will illustrate very clearly.The structure of heart and lungs must be studied in the same way.P. 377, c. 1.—“Cerebrum.” If the upper part of the brain is removedfrom a pigeon, it at once sinks into a dull, stupid state, showing thatits faculties are taken from it.P. 377, c. 1.—“Cerebellum.” The lower part of the brain. If removedfrom a pigeon, it loses all control of the nerves, sprawling andfluttering as if crazy. These experiments and observations may beextended indefinitely. The more the better, for original work is ofmore value in science than much reading.“SUNDAY READINGS.”P. 377, c. 2.—The article on “History of Education” in the NovemberCHAUTAUQUAN will be interesting to read in connection with “Law ofthe Household.” It explains how the family idea was the basis of theChinese system of government and education.P. 377, c. 2.—“E. A. Washburn.” The rector of Calvary Church, New York,and the author of “The Social Law of God,” from which this article istaken.P. 377, c. 2.—“Anthropoid ape.” A man-like ape.

An English poet, critic, andconversationalist. He was a man of wonderful powers, but his works areonly fragments. The best known poems are probably “Christabel” and“Ancient Mariner.” He was one of the Lake school poets.P. 378, c. 2.—“Rousseau.” A French author of the eighteenth century,celebrated both for his peculiar character and the morbid, sentimentalenthusiasm of his writings. Among his works is one entitled “The SavageState,” to which the writer here refers.P. 378, c. 2.—“Jerome.” The most learned and eloquent of the Latinfathers. He was a contemporary of St. Augustine, living in the fourthcentury. Much of his time was spent in solitary study and thought. Hiscommentaries on the Bible are especially valuable for their learning.His opinions and argument are, however, marked by much violence.P. 379, c. 1.—“Epicurism.” A term, as now used, equivalent tovoluptuousness. The term signifies the doctrines of Epicurus, whichdoctrines were very different from the common opinion. Epicurus heldthat happiness is the highest good; not present happiness, but that ofthe whole life; that no true pleasure was possible without virtue. Hemakes temperance the foundation of joy; not wealth, but few wants beingthe basis of earthly good.P. 379, c. 1.—“De Tocqueville,” deh-tok´vil. A French politician andwriter of the present century. In 1831 he visited the United States tostudy her institutions, publishing after his return, “Democracy inAmerica,” a work of great value. In 1861 the _Edinburgh Review_ saysof this work: “Far from having suffered by the lapse of a quarter of acentury, it has gained in authority and interest.” De Tocqueville diedin 1859.P. 379, c. 1.—“Wordsworth” (1770-1850). An English poet, the founder ofthe Lake school of poets. The value of his poems lies principally inhis fine sensibility to nature. He was the advocate of peculiar methodsfor writing poetry. One was that the language of the poem should bethat of the peasant; another, that poetic diction should be the same asprose. All the valuable work that he did, however, was in opposition tothese principles.P. 379, c. 1.—“William M. Taylor.” Pastor of the Broadway Tabernacle,New York City; author of “David, King of Israel,” “Elijah the Prophet,”and “Peter the Apostle.” From the latter volume this article is taken.P. 380, c. 1.—“Trench.” An eminent English ecclesiast and philologist,born in 1807.P. 380, c. 1.—“Archimedes.” The most celebrated of ancientmathematicians.

Eureka!”P. 380, c. 1.—“Matthew Henry.” An eminent English divine, born in1662. His most important work is his commentary on the “Old and NewTestaments,” thought by many to be the best work of the kind everpublished.P. 380, c. 2.—“Thomas Scott.” An English calvanistic divine, living inthe latter part of the eighteenth century.P. 381, c. 2.—“Thomas Chalmers,” chaw´mers.

A writer of the eighteenthcentury. His father was a poor book-seller, who aided him verylittle in his schooling. He was soon obliged to leave the universityand begin teaching. Failing here he became a literary drudge for abook-seller. After many years of severe poverty and toil Johnson, atthe age of fifty-three, received a pension. After this his life wasmore congenial, friends increased, and his work prospered. His firstimportant book was the life of the poet Savage. For eight years heworked on his dictionary, which long held a high rank in the country.In 1759 he wrote “Rasselas,” from which the selection in the presentnumber of THE CHAUTAUQUAN is taken. It is said to have been writtenin a week, to pay the expenses of his mother’s funeral. It is awork without plot, being a series of dialogues and reflections uponliterary, moral, and social questions. Afterward his “Lives of thePoets” was written. Johnson is best studied through “Boswell’s Life ofJohnson.” Though marked by conspicuous faults, few men have receivedmore admiration than Johnson.P. 424, c. 1.—“Addison” (1672-1719). An English writer. In his boyhoodhe showed marked literary ability. After leaving college he traveledin Italy and France. His fame was made by his poem, “Campaign.”After this various political offices were given him. About 1708, inconnection with Swift, he edited the gossipy sheets known successivelyas _The Tatler_, _The Spectator_, _The Guardian_. These were designedto educate the moral and social ideas of the English people, whothen were both immoral and illiterate. Addison’s articles are modelsof literature, and have given him permanent fame. His character washarmonious and lovable.P. 424, c. 2.—“Absalon and Achitophel.” A political satire, by Dryden,published in 1681.

This was carried to Constantinople by Theodosius the Great,and there destroyed.P. 425, c. 2.—“Praxiteles,” prax-it´e-leez. A Greek sculptor of thefourth century B. C. Little is known of his personal history. His mostfamous work is his Venus of Cnidus.THE HAMPTON TRACTS.Nothing in the way of explanation is needed on these admirable“Hampton Tracts.” All that the notes will try to do is to enforcetheir importance. They certainly contain the foundation principles ofhealth, and C. L. S. C. members have a work of reform laid upon themby their knowledge, which should be carried on at home, in schoolsand churches. Homes can not be happy if vitiated by uncleanliness andimpure air; schools will fail in their work, and no spiritual good willcome to the man who willingly disobeys the laws of health. Howard, thephilanthropist, was once asked what precautions he took in visitingsick-rooms. He replied, “After the goodness of God, temperance andcleanliness are my preservations.” These preservations are within thereach of everyone. Fresh air, fresh water and sunlight are worth allthe physicians and drugs of the times. Perhaps the hardest difficultyto contend with is a damp or marshy location, and it may not be amissto note that, in France and Holland, sunflowers planted on an extensivescale have done much to disinfect the marshy tracts. It is quitepossible that a permanent good may be done where C. L. S. C. circlesare instituted, by the circles turning themselves into health clubs.Ten or fifteen minutes of every session devoted to health would keep upan active interest in the subject, would spread much needed knowledge,and work reform in the community.[_Required Reading for April._]ENGLISH LITERATURE.THE POET DESCRIBED.By S. JOHNSON.“Wherever I went, I found that poetry was considered as the highestlearning, and regarded with a veneration somewhat approaching tothat which man would pay to the angelic nature. And it yet fills mewith wonder, that in almost all countries the most ancient poetsare considered as the best; whether it be that every other kind ofknowledge is an acquisition gradually attained, and poetry is a giftconferred at once; or that the first poetry of every nation surprisedthem as a novelty, and retained the credit by consent which it receivedby accident at first; or whether, as the province of poetry is todescribe nature and passion, which are always the same, the firstwriters took possession of the most striking objects for description,and the most probable occurrences for fiction, and left nothing forthose that followed them but transcriptions of the same events, and newcombinations of the same images. Whatever be the reason, it is commonlyobserved, that the early writers are in possession of nature, and theirfollowers, of art; that the first excel in strength and invention, andthe latter in elegance and refinement.“I was desirous to add my name to this illustrious fraternity. I readall the poets of Persia and Arabia, and was able to repeat by memorythe volumes that are suspended in the mosque of Mecca. But I soonfound that no man was ever great by imitation. My desire of excellenceimpelled me to transfer my attention to nature and to life. Nature wasto be my subject, and men to be my auditors; I could never describewhat I had not seen; I could not hope to move those with delight orterror whose interests and opinions I did not understand.“Being now resolved to be a poet, I saw everything with a new purpose:my sphere of attention was suddenly magnified; no kind of knowledgewas to be overlooked. I ranged mountains and deserts for images andresemblances, and pictured upon my mind every tree of the forest andflower of the valley. I observed with equal care the crags of the rockand the pinnacles of the palace. Sometimes I wandered along the mazesof the rivulet, and sometimes watched the changes of the summer clouds.To a poet nothing can be useless. Whatever is beautiful, and whateveris dreadful, must be familiar to his imagination; he must be conversantwith all that is awfully vast or elegantly little. The plants of thegarden, the animals of the wood, the minerals of the earth, the meteorsof the sky, must all concur to store his mind with inexhaustiblevariety; for every idea is useful for the enforcement or decoration ofmoral or religious truth; and he who knows most will have most powerof diversifying his scenes, and of gratifying his reader with remoteallusions and unexpected instruction.“All the appearances of nature I was therefore careful to study, andevery country which I have surveyed has contributed something to mypoetical powers.”“In so wide a survey,” said the prince, “you must surely have leftmuch unobserved. I have lived till now, within the circuit of thesemountains, and yet can not walk abroad without the sight of somethingwhich I never beheld before, or never heeded.”“The business of a poet,” said Imlac, “is to examine, not theindividual, but the species; to remark general properties andlarge appearances; he does not number the streaks of the tulip, ordescribe the different shades in the verdure of the forest. He isto exhibit in his portraits of nature such prominent and strikingfeatures as recall the original to every mind; and must neglect theminuter discriminations, which one may have remarked and anotherhave neglected, for those characteristics which are alike obvious tovigilance and carelessness.“But the knowledge of nature is only half the task of a poet; he mustbe acquainted likewise with all the modes of life. His characterrequires that he estimate the happiness and misery of every condition,observe the power of all the passions in all their combinations, andtrace the changes of the human mind as they are modified by variousinstitutions, and accidental influences of climate or custom, fromthe sprightliness of infancy to the despondency of decrepitude. Hemust divest himself of the prejudices of his age or country; he mustconsider right and wrong in their abstract and invariable state;he must disregard present laws and opinions, and rise to generaland transcendental truths, which will always be the same; he musttherefore content himself with the slow progress of his name; contemnthe applause of his own time, and commit his claims to the justiceof posterity. He must write as the interpreter of nature, and thelegislator of mankind, and consider himself as presiding over thethoughts and manners of future generations, as a being superior to timeand place.“His labor is not yet at an end: he must know many languages, and manysciences; and, that his style may be worthy of his thoughts, must, byincessant practice, familiarize to himself every delicacy of speech andgrace of harmony.”ON GIVING ADVICE.By JOSEPH ADDISON.There is nothing which we receive with so much reluctance as advice.We look upon the man who gives it us as offering an affront to ourunderstanding, and treating us like children or idiots. We considerthe instruction as an implicit censure, and the zeal which any oneshows for our good on such an occasion, as a piece of presumption orimpertinence. The truth of it is, the person who pretends to advise,does, in that particular, exercise a superiority over us, and canhave no other reason for it but that, in comparing us with himself,he thinks us defective either in our conduct or our understanding.For these reasons there is nothing so difficult as the art of makingadvice agreeable; and, indeed, all the writers, both ancient andmodern, have distinguished themselves among one another, according tothe perfection at which they have arrived in this art. How devices havebeen made use of to render this bitter potion palatable! some conveytheir instructions to us in the best chosen words, others in the mostharmonious numbers; some in points of wit, and others in short proverbs.But among all the different ways of giving counsel, I think the finest,and that which pleases the most universally, is fable, in whatsoevershape it appears. If we consider this way of instructing or givingadvice, it excels all others, because it is the least shocking, and theleast subject to those exceptions which I have before mentioned.This will appear to us, if we reflect, in the first place, that uponreading of a fable we are made to believe we advise ourselves.[P]We peruse the author for the sake of the story, and consider theprecepts rather as our own conclusions, than his instructions. Themoral insinuates itself imperceptibly, we are taught by surprise, andbecome wiser and better unawares. In short, by this method a man isso far over-reached as to think he is directing himself, whilst he isfollowing the dictates of another, and consequently is not sensible ofthat which is the most unpleasing circumstance in advice.In the next place, if we look into human nature, we shall find that themind is never so much pleased as when she exerts herself in any actionthat gives her an idea of her own perfections and abilities. Thisnatural pride and ambition of the soul is very much gratified in thereading of a fable: for in writings of this kind, the reader comes infor half of the performance; everything appears to him like a discoveryof his own; he is busied all the while in applying characters andcircumstances, and is in this respect both a reader and a composer. Itis no wonder, therefore, that on such occasions, when the mind is thuspleased with itself, and amused with its own discoveries, it is highlydelighted with the writing which is the occasion of it. For this reasonthe Absalon and Achitophel was one of the most popular poems that everappeared in English. The poetry is indeed very fine, but had it beenmuch finer it would not have so much pleased, without a plan which gavethe reader an opportunity of exerting his own talents.This oblique manner of giving advice is so inoffensive, that if we lookinto ancient histories, we find the wise men of old very often chose[Q]to give counsel to their kings in fables. To omit many which will occurto every one’s memory, there is a pretty instance of this nature in aTurkish tale, which I do[R] not like the worse for that little Orientalextravagance which is mixed with it.We are told that the Sultan Mahmoud, by his perpetual wars abroad, andhis tyranny at home, had filled his dominions with ruin and desolation,and half unpeopled the Persian empire. The vizier to this great sultan(whether an humorist or an enthusiast we are not informed) pretended tohave learned of a certain dervise to understand the language of birds,so that there was not a bird that could open his mouth but the vizierknew what it was he said. As he was one evening with the emperor,on their return from hunting, they saw a couple of owls upon a treethat grew near an old wall, out of an heap of rubbish. “I would fainknow,” says the sultan, “what those two owls are saying to one another;listen to their discourse, and give me an account of it.” The vizierapproached the tree, pretending to be very attentive to the two owls.Upon his return to the sultan, “Sir,” says he, “I have heard part oftheir conversation, but dare not tell you what it is.” The sultan wouldnot be satisfied with such an answer, but forced him to repeat word forword everything that the owls had said. “You must know then,” said thevizier, “that one of these owls has a son, and the other a daughter,between whom they are now upon a treaty of marriage. The father of theson said to the father of the daughter, in my hearing, ‘Brother, Iconsent to this marriage, provided you will settle upon your daughterfifty ruined villages for her portion.’ To which the father of thedaughter replied, ‘Instead of fifty, I will give her five hundred, ifyou please. God grant a long life to Sultan Mahmoud; whilst he reignsover us, we shall never want ruined villages.’”The story says, the sultan was so touched with the fable, that herebuilt the towns and villages which had been destroyed, and from thattime forward consulted the good of his people.To fill up my paper I shall add a most ridiculous piece of naturalmagic, which was taught by no less a philosopher than Democritus,namely, that[S] if the blood of certain birds, which he mentioned,were mixed together, it would produce a serpent of such wonderfulvirtue, that whoever did eat it should be skilled in the language ofbirds, and understand everything they said to one another. Whether thedervise above-mentioned might not have eaten such a serpent, I shallleave to the determinations of the learned.EDUCATION COMPARED TO SCULPTURE.By JOSEPH ADDISON.I consider an human soul without education, like marble in the quarry,which shows none of its inherent beauties, till the skill of thepolisher fetches out the colors, makes the surface shine, and discoversevery ornamental cloud, spot, and vein, that runs through the body ofit. Education, after the same manner, when it works upon a noble mind,draws out to view every latent virtue and perfection, which withoutsuch helps are never able to make their appearance.If my reader will give me leave to change the allusion so soon uponhim, I shall make use of the same instance to illustrate the forceof education, which Aristotle has brought to explain his doctrineof substantial forms, when he tells us that a statue lies hid in ablock of marble; and that the art of the statuary only clears awaythe superfluous matter, and removes the rubbish. The figure is in thestone, the sculptor only finds it. What sculpture is to a block ofmarble, education is to an human soul. The philosopher, the saint,or the hero, the wise, the good, or the great man, very often liehid and concealed in a plebeian, which a proper education might havedisinterred, and have brought to light. I am, therefore, much delightedwith reading the accounts of savage nations, and with contemplatingthose virtues which are wild and uncultivated; to see courage exertingitself in fierceness, resolution in obstinacy, wisdom in cunning,patience in sullenness and despair.I can not forbear mentioning a story which I have lately heard, andwhich is so well attested, that I have no manner of reason to suspectthe truth of it: I may call it a kind of wild tragedy that passed abouttwelve years ago at St. Christopher’s, one of our British LeewardIslands. The negroes who were concerned in it were all of them slavesof a gentleman who is now in England.This gentleman, among his negroes, had a young woman, who was lookedupon as a most extraordinary beauty by those of her own complexion. Hehad at the same time two young fellows, who were likewise negroes andslaves, remarkable for the comeliness of their persons, and for thefriendship which they bore to one another. It unfortunately happenedthat both of them fell in love with the female negro above-mentioned,who would have been very glad to have taken either of them for herhusband, provided they could agree between themselves which should bethe man. But they were both so passionately in love with her, thatneither of them could think of giving her up to his rival; and at thesame time were so true to one another, that neither of them would thinkof gaining her without his friend’s consent. The torments of thesetwo lovers were the discourse of the family to which they belonged,who could not forbear observing the strange complication of passionswhich perplexed the hearts of the poor negroes, that often droppedexpressions of the uneasiness they underwent, and how impossible it wasfor either of them ever to be happy.After a long struggle between love and friendship, truth and jealousy,they one day took a walk together into a wood, carrying their mistressalong with them; where, after abundance of lamentation, they stabbedher to the heart, of which she immediately died. A slave, who was athis work not far from the place where this astonishing piece of crueltywas committed, hearing the shrieks of the dying person, ran to see whatwas the occasion of them. He there discovered the woman lying deadupon the ground, with the two negroes on each side of her kissing thedead corpse, weeping over it, and beating their breasts in the utmostagonies of grief and despair. He immediately ran to the English familywith the news of what he had seen; who, upon coming to the place, sawthe woman dead, and the two negroes expiring by her with wounds theyhad given themselves.We see in this amazing instance of barbarity, what strange disordersare bred in the minds of those men whose passions are not regulatedby virtue, and disciplined by reason. Though the action which I haverecited is in itself full of guilt and horror, it proceeded from atemper of mind which might have produced very noble fruits, had it beenformed and guided by a suitable education.It is, therefore, an unspeakable blessing to be born in those partsof the world where wisdom and knowledge flourish; though it must beconfessed, there are, even in these parts, several poor uninstructedpersons, who are but little above the inhabitants of those nations ofwhich I have been here speaking; as those who have had the advantage ofa more liberal education, rise above one another by several differentdegrees of perfection. For to return to our statue in the block ofmarble, we see it sometimes only begun to be chipped, sometimesrough-hewn, and but just sketched in an human figure; sometimes we seethe man appearing distinctly in all his limbs and features, sometimeswe find the figure wrought up to a great elegancy, but seldom meetwith any to which the hand of a Phidias or a Praxiteles could not giveseveral nice touches and finishings.BEST BAKING POWDER.INTERESTING TESTS MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT CHEMIST.Dr. Edward G. Love, the present Analytical Chemist for the Government,has recently made some interesting experiments as to the comparativevalue of baking powders. Dr. Love’s tests were made to determine whatbrands are the most economical to use, and as their capacity lies intheir leavening power, tests were directed solely to ascertain theavailable gas of each powder. Dr. Love’s report gives the following:      Name of the                      Strength Cubic Inches    Baking Powders.

Phosphates and TartaricAcid powders liberate their gas too freely in process of baking, orunder varying climatic changes suffer deterioration.”Dr. H. A.

By R. BOSWORTH SMITH, M. A., late Fellow of Trinity    College, Assistant Master at Harrow School: author of    “Carthage and the Carthaginians,” “Rome and Carthage,”    “Mohammed and Mohammedanism,” etc. With maps and    portraits. 2 vols., 8vo, $5.    These two volumes contain the biography of one of the    most remarkable Englishmen of our time. John Lawrence    exemplified the highest and most characteristic    qualities and virtues of an Anglo-Saxon, and his life    is the history, more or less complete, of British    rule in India during the most memorable period since    Englishmen first gained a footing there. Lawrence’s    career is first traced, from the time when he went out    as a young student for the Indian service, through    the rapid steps that brought him into positions of    authority and showed his extraordinary tact and    firmness in dealing with the native population, up to    the time when his position as the master of Indian    administration was recognized in his appointment to    the Lieutenant Governorship of the Punjab. But it is    of course in the period of the mutiny that Lawrence,    as the “Savior of the Punjab,” reaches his full    development, and it would not be easy to exaggerate the    power of this part of Mr. Bosworth Smith’s narrative in    awakening enthusiasm for his subject. But it will be    found that Mr. Smith has given the work even greater    claims to attention, by making of it one of those    great biographies which form, perhaps, one of the most    interesting groups in literature—the few books in which    a vigorous individuality is brought out with perfect    success.Recollections of Arthur Penrhyn Stanley,  Late Dean of Westminster. Three lectures delivered    in Edinburgh, in November, 1882. By GEORGE GRANVILLE    BRADLEY, D.D., Dean of Westminster, Honorary Fellow of    University College, Oxford. 1 vol., 12mo, $1.    These recollections, written down by his successor    and life-long friend, and covering the whole course    of Stanley’s life, make up so fine and sympathetic    a picture of the man, that even if a more ambitious    biography appears later, these reminiscences will be    preferred to it by many. The accounts of Stanley’s life    at Rugby and Oxford, and of his early manhood, have    a special attraction. The whole memoir, while by no    means effusive, communicates to the reader much of the    feeling with which Dean Beadley writes of an intimate    friendship “of more than forty years.”Final Causes.  By PAUL JANET, Member of the French Academy. Translated    from the Second French Edition. With Preface, by PROF.    ROBERT FLINT, D.D., LL.D. 1 vol., 8vo, $2.50.    “No book of greater importance in the realm of    theological philosophy has appeared during the past    twenty years than Paul Janet’s ‘Final Causes.’ The    central idea of the work is one which the whole    course of scientific discussion has made the burning    question of the day, viz., that final causes are not    inconsistent with physical causation. Janet does    not contend against evolution in Nature; but only    against the atheistic interpretation of evolution,    which denies the presence in it or operation behind    it of intelligent and definitive finality.”—_The    Independent._Socrates.  A Translation of the Apology, Crito, and parts of the    Phædo of Plato.

FIELD, D.D., author of “From the Lakes of    Killarney to the Golden Horn,” and “Egypt to Japan.” 1    vol. crown 8vo, with a map, $2.    This volume is the account of a journey in the track of    the Israelites along the Red Sea, among the peaks of    Sinai, through the Desert of the Wandering, and up to    the Promised Land.    From Rev. Wm. M. Taylor, D.D.: “I was so interested    in its perusal that it was with difficulty that I    could persuade myself to lay it down. I find it more    interesting than a novel, and full, besides, of    valuable information, sound reflection, and clear    thinking. The descriptions enable one to see for    himself the objects on which the writer looked. The    style is clearness itself. One never feels at a loss    to know the meaning, and is never tempted to read    a section over again to be sure that he has quite    understood it; but is borne along with a delightful    sense of enjoyment. Without the jolting and fatigue of    riding on a camel’s back, one has all the pleasure of    an excursion through those scenes which must be forever    sacred to the lovers of the Word of God. Nor must I    forget to add that every now and then a delightful    humor bubbles up in these pages, which adds immensely    to the charm of a very charming book.”The Religions of the Ancient World.  Including Egypt, Assyria and Babylonia, Persia, India,    Phœnicia, Etruria, Greece, Rome. By GEORGE RAWLINSON,    M.A., author of “The Origin of Nations,” etc. 1 vol.,    12mo, $1.    “The historical studies which have elevated this    author’s works to the highest position have made him    familiar with those beliefs which once directed the    world’s thought; and he has done literature no better    service than in this little volume.... The book is,    then, to be accepted as a sketch, and as the most    trustworthy sketch in our language, of the religions    discussed.”—_N. Y. Christian Advocate._An Honorable Surrender.  By MARY ADAMS. 1 vol., 12mo, $1.    “‘An Honorable Surrender’ is a healthful, breezy,    American romance, not abounding in incidents or    dramatic situations, but clever and readable on every    page. For the writer knows human nature well, and looks    on the sunny side of it; while her literary style is    pure, graceful, and polished. It is some time since we    have read so bright a little novel.”—_Phila. Bulletin._Ice-Pack and Tundra.  An Account of the Search for the _Jeannette_ and a    Sledge Journey Through Siberia. By WILLIAM H. GILDER,    correspondent of the New York _Herald_, with the    Rodgers Search Expedition; author of “Schwatka’s    Search.” 1 vol, 8vo, with maps and illustrations, $4.    Mr. Gilder’s book is an account of the voyage of the    _Rodgers_, her discoveries and destruction; with the    thrilling personal narrative of his own solitary and    perilous journey through the Siberian wastes. The whole    story of the _Jeannette_ is given from its papers and    the accounts of survivors. It will be seen that the    volume possesses an extraordinary interest.Dorner on the Future State.  Being a Translation of the Section of his System of    Christian doctrine, comprising the Doctrine of the    Last Things. With an Introduction and Notes. By NEWMAN    SMYTH, D.D., author of “Old Faiths in New Light,” “The    Orthodox Theology of To-day,” etc. 1 vol., 12mo, $1.    “The present book is only one of the series of    treatises which Dorner has written; but it contains    most of the distinctive views by which he is best    known. It is an attempt in plain words to bring the    doctrine of Christian eschatology into harmony with    the best knowledge and the best thought of the age....    It brings theology into harmony with man’s deepest    longings, and bathes its rugged logical corners    with the melting tenderness of Divine love.”—_N. Y.    Tribune._Webster: An Ode.  By W. C. WILKINSON. 1 vol, small 4to, $2.00.    “Upon opening this fine volume one perceives instantly    that he has before him a piece of literary work done in    that spirit of literary conscientiousness of which we    have been speaking. But while he finds this conviction    justified as he reads on, he finds also another thing    true, and that is, that the poem is written from the    heart, a genuine effusion of love for the memory of a    great man.”—_Chicago Standard._    *** _These Books are for sale by all booksellers, or will be sent,               post-paid, on receipt of the price, by_    CHARLES SCRIBNER’S SONS, 743 and 745 Broadway, New York.       *       *       *       *       *FOOTNOTES:[A] In the “Editor’s Table,” pages 419-423, will be found thepronunciation of hard words, and explanatory and suggestive notes onthe Required Readings for April. _The Readings in “English Literature”commence on page 423._[B] A table land of Central Asia, called by those who dwell upon it“the roof of the world.” It touches the Hindoo-Koosh Mountains, andLake Siri-Kol, the source of the Oxus, on the south.

She was taken under the protection of King Heimer, who roamedabout with her in the guise of a Northern minstrel. By the aid of magicKing Heimer was enabled to reduce her size, so that she could hidewithin his harp in time of danger. When this had passed, at his wordshe came forth restored to her full stature.[I] “Studies in the Gospels,” p. 67.[J] A Rabbinical story relates that Abraham, on approaching Egypt,locked Sarah in a chest, that none might behold her beauty. On arrivingat the place of paying custom, he was asked for the dues, which he saidhe would pay. “Thou carriest clothes?” and Abraham offered for those,and gold and other things as they were asked, the required value. Atlength the collectors said, “Surely, it must be pearls that thou takestwith thee?” and he only answered, “I will pay for pearls.” Seeingthat they could name nothing of value for which the patriarch was notwilling to pay custom, they said, “It can not be but thou open thebox, and let us see what is therein.” So they opened the box, and thewhole land of Egypt was illuminated by the luster of Sarah’s beauty—farexceeding even that of pearls.Gautama (Buddha), five hundred years B. C., on the birth of his child,received an ovation from his countrymen. Among the songs of triumphwhich greeted his ear, one especially, by his cousin, attracted him. Hetook off his necklace of pearls, and sent it to the minstrel.[K] The _Echidna_, or Australian hedgehog, and the _Ornithorhynchus_,or water-mole of New South Wales, belong to the _Monotremes_.[L] A lecture delivered in the Amphitheater, at Chautauqua, July 28,1882.[M] A conference held in the Amphitheater at Chautauqua, August 3,1882.
